This directory holds Perl scripts that we use for configuring versions of ACE.

configureMarvin.pl	establishes the symlinks that Marvin needs and that the
					requested version of ACE needs to access the requested 
					version of Marvin.
configureJChem.pl	establishes the symlinks that JChem needs and that the
					requested version of ACE needs to access the requested
					version of JChem; also calls configureMarvin.pl for the 
					version of Marvin inside the requested version of JChem.
					Point ACE to a lower version of JChem by changing the
					symlink $BASE/jchemWHO, where WHO is the version of ACE,
					manually.
cpDiff.pl			copies source files that differ between versions
cpSole.pl			copies source files that only exist in one version to another
createACEcopy.pl	creates a new version
setIdentity.pl		establishes symlinks and some other files that ACE needs;
					constructs the symlinks according to the ones present in 
					the directory $BASE/identity/ .  After running, manually 
					change epoch-plugin/web/nosession/marvin to point to a 
					different version of Marvin, if desired.

Examples: 

	setIdentity.pl DEV-2.3
	configureJChem.pl DEV-2.3 jchem5.3.3
	configureMarvin.pl DEV-2.2 jchem5.3.2/marvin
