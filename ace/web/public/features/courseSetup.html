<h3>Setting up a course</h3>

<p>ACE has been designed to require as little time as possible for you to get
started. You first need to <a href="/ace/login.jsp">register</a> 
with ACE (as an instructor), and the ACE administrator
needs to verify that you are indeed an instructor.  
</p>

<p>After the ACE administrator has verified your status, when you log in, 
you will see your user home page:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/userHome1.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Note that ACE automatically makes the Tutorial course visible to you; you can
enter it and work the tutorials, although you cannot change them.</p>

<p>To create a course of your own, press <b>Add course</b>.  Enter the information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/addCrs1.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>When you have finished, press <b>Add course</b>.  ACE will return you to the 
user home page, where your new course will now be listed.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/userHome2.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>If you wish, you can add coinstructors to your course.  Coinstructors have all
of the privileges of the owner of the course (yourself).  Simply press the <b>Manage
coinstructors</b> icon for your course, choose the institution and name of the instructor,
and press <b>Add</b>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/manageCoinstr.png" alt="image"/></p>

<a id="crsHome"></a>
<p>From your user home page, click on the name of your course to enter it.  You will
arrive at the course home page.  If you want to enter a message to your students, 
press the <b>Edit</b> icon next to "Notes."  The course home page also has three tabs:
<b>Assignments</b>, <b>Grade Book</b>, and <b>Enrollment</b>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/crsHome1.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>To enroll students in your course, press the <b>Enrollment</b> tab.  ACE provides
several ways to enroll students in your course.  The easiest way is to upload a
spreadsheet that contains your students' names and their ID numbers.  You can also
choose to enroll individual students, either by finding them in a list of students
from your institution who have registered with ACE, or by entering their names and 
student ID numbers individually.  After you enroll students in your course, they will
be able to enter it and look at any <a href="assgtSetup.html">assignments</a> that
you have created.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/enroll1.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Whichever method you choose, after you have enrolled your students in the course,
you will see a list of your students' names, ID numbers, ACE usernames, the email
addresses that they entered when they enrolled, and whether they have enrolled with ACE.
You can choose to promote one or more of the enrolled students to TA, and you can choose
to disenroll any students who have dropped the course.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/enroll2.png" alt="image"/></p>

<p>TAs can see the enrollment list, but they cannot take any actions on it.  Ordinary 
students cannot see the enrollment list at all.
