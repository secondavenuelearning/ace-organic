<h3>Discussion forum</h3>

<p>An instructor can choose to create a discussion forum within a course. 
Both instructors and students can start threads and post responses in 
the forum; instructors can make a thread sticky, delete posts, or block
a student from the forum. The ACE forum is more useful than other 
readily available discussion tools because, in addition to text, a post 
may include a MarvinJS drawing, a LewisJS drawing, or 
an image. </p>

<p>The forum is intimately linked with the assignment questions. Each
question on the assignment questions page has associated with it a 
<b>Start forum topic</b> button. A user who presses this button and 
begins a thread on the forum links the new thread to the question. 
Thereafter, the forum will have a link from the thread back to the 
question on the assignment questions page, and the assignment 
questions page will show a <b>Go to forum topic</b> button. This 
feature allows easy movement between a forum thread about a problematic 
question and the question itself. If a user has included a Marvin or 
LewisJS drawing with his or her post, another user can copy that drawing,
go back to the question linked to the thread, paste the response onto
the drawing canvas, and submit it to see how ACE responds.
