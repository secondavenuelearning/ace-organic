<h3>Gradebook</h3>

<p>When a user clicks on the <span class="link">Gradebook</span> tab, ACE loads
<span class="filename">grade.jsp</span>, the overall gradebook.  If the user is
a student and not a TA, the overall gradebook displays that student's grades in each 
<a href="assgnts.shtml">assignment</a>.  
(However, if any assignment is a 
<a href="assgnts.shtml#mastery">mastery assignment</a>, then the gradebook
displays only whether the student has mastered <i>every</i> question 
in that assignment.)
If the user is an instructor or a TA, the overall gradebook displays the 
same for every student in the class (except the TAs) as well as whether
each student has begun or completed each tutorial.  
The overall gradebook labels each column as 
<span class="link">Set <i>n</i></span> (or, for a 
<a href="assgnts.shtml#mastery">mastery assignment</a>, 
<span class="link">Set M<i>n</i></span>), but the
user may mouse over the link to see the assignment name. 
The grades
that ACE displays in the overall gradebook usually reflect any attempt-, 
time-, or question-dependent grading parameters that instructors entered
when they <a href="assgnts.shtml">created particular assignments</a>.

<!--#include file="db/hwset_grading_params.html"-->

<p>The user may choose to export the overall gradebook into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet.  The file <span class="filename">gradeTxt.jsp</span>
sets the output document's type; it then includes 
<span class="filename">grade.jsp</span>, which generates the output. </p>

<p>If the user clicks on <span class="link">Set <i>n</i></span>, the detailed
gradebook for that assignment, <span class="filename">detailedGrade.jsp</span>,
opens.  The detailed gradebook shows for each question in the assignment the
number of points earned (or, if the assignment is a 
<a href="assgnts.shtml#mastery">mastery assignment</a>, 
whether the student has mastered the question),
the number of attempts, a checkmark (&radic;) if the instructor has
commented on the student's response, and a link to display the 
<a href="solve.shtml">student's last response</a>.  (If the instructor has set
the assignment option to save all responses, the instructor may also choose 
to see a student's previous responses.) Again, the user may choose to
export the detailed gradebook into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  The
file <span class="filename">detailedGradeTxt.jsp</span> sets the
output document's type; it then includes 
<span class="filename">detailedGrade.jsp</span>, which generates the output.
</p>

<p>For instructors, the detailed gradebook has three other important
features.  </p>
<ul><li>If an instructor has modified a question so that responses that were
previously marked as correct are now marked as incorrect, or vice versa, 
he or she may wish to regrade it by clicking on the 
<span class="link">Regrade</span> link at the bottom of its column.  
Likewise, if the instructor has chosen the 
<a href="assgnts.html#props">delay grading</a> option for the assignment,
the instructor can click on the <span class="link">Regrade all</span> link.
The regrade process reevaluates every student's last response and generates 
a list of students whose grades have changed.

</li><li>An instructor may alter a student's record on a question by clicking 
on the name of that student, which causes
<span class="filename">detailedGrade.jsp</span> to reload in a different 
mode.  On this page, the instructor may click on the 
<span class="link">alter</span> link 
underneath the student's grade on each question to enter a new
grade or number of attempts for that student and question.  The reset process 
simply alters the <a href="solve.shtml#responses">database record</a> 
of the student's responses; ACE does not reevaluate the response.  
Some details of the database changes are:
<ul>
<li>If the instructor reduces the number of attempts of the most recent 
response from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>, then ACE deletes all responses with 
attempts from <i>y</i> to <i>x</i> &ndash; 1, then changes the number
of attempts of the most recent response.  An instructor may not increase the
number of attempts.
</li>
<li>If the instructor changes the grade of
an earlier response, then ACE deletes all more recent responses, and the
altered response becomes the most recent one.
</li>
</ul>

</li><li>An instructor may also use the record-altering page to enter a 
comment on a student's response.  ACE displays the comment to the student 
on the <a href="solve.shtml#answer">question-answering page</a> after the feedback.
</li></ul>
