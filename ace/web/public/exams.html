<h2 style="text-align:center;">Exams in ACE</h2>

<p>We have introduced many features that make administering 
exams with ACE easier and more secure.  This document describes how to use 
ACE to administer exams.</p>

<h4>Preparing the exam</h4>

<ol><li><a href="authoring.html">Enter the exam questions</a> in the question bank.  

</li><li>On the courses list page, press <span class="link">Add course</span> 
to create a new course that students will use only for the exam.  
Set the time that the students will be able to enter the course
to the start time of the exam, and check the box that 
indicates that the course will be used for exams.
<ul>
<li>You can choose to tell ACE to omit calculated products 
from feedback to responses to synthesis questions.  
(Incorrect responses to synthesis questions sometimes elicit 
feedback that shows the products that ACE calculates from the
reaction.  Students can use this feature to calculate the answers
to "draw the products" questions on an exam.)  If you choose this
option, then, after a student enters <i>this</i> course, he 
or she will no longer see calculated products in the feedback to
synthesis questions in <i>any</i> course.  
</li><li>You may choose to restrict the IP addresses that students may use when 
entering this course.  This restriction does not apply to the instructor or
TAs.  You may enter each IP address individually as "a.b.c.d", you may enter an 
entire domain in the form "a.b.c", you may use an IP address along with a subnet
mask in the form "a.b.c.d/w.x.y.z", or you may use CIDR notation in the form
"a.b.c.d/n".
</li><li>You may choose to require a course password to enter the course.  This
feature is useful if you decline to use random exam IDs (see below).  If you 
choose this option, proctors should log students into the exam remotely without
revealing the course password to the students so that students cannot
log into one another's accounts and see each other's work on the exam.
</li><li>If you are going to offer the exam at more than one time, you have two 
options.
<ul>
<li>
You can use this option if you are using exam IDs.
After the first offering of the exam, go to the courses list page,
press the <span class="link">Edit</span> button next to the exam course,
and set the time to enter the course to be the start time of the next exam
offering.
Reenter the exam course, press the <span class="link">Assignments</span>
tab, and press <span class="link">Edit exam features</span> (or, if there is
only one assignment, press the <span class="link">Edit 2</span> button).
Set the due date and time of the exam to the <i>start</i> time of the 
next offering of the exam, and save. Then press 
<span class="link">Edit exam features</span> again, and, in the box next to
Unused exam students, enter the amount of time (in minutes) that the 
students will have to take the exam.
</li><li>
Create a separate course for each exam offering.  
(You may find it easiest simply to clone your first exam course 
with the <img src="../images/duplicateButton.gif" alt="the clone icon"/> 
button to the right of the first exam course's name on the courses list 
page.  This button will copy the course information and the assignments of 
the cloned course into the new course, but not the enrollment list. If you 
are going to give the same exam each time, exercise this option after you 
have assembled the assignments so that you do not have to reassemble them 
or export and import them.)
Incorporate the time of each exam into the name of each course.
</ul>
</ul>

</li><li>Assemble the questions that you wrote into assignments, 
flagging the assignments as exams.  
<ul>
<li>Set the due date and time for each assignment to the end time of
the exam.  
</li><li>Set question- and attempt-dependent grading parameters for each 
assignment.  
</li><li>You may choose to save all students' responses to the database,
rather than only students' final responses.  If you exercise
this option, you will be able to use the gradebook to look at all of a 
student's responses to a question.
</li><li>You may choose to delay grading for the assignment until after the
exam is completed.  If you choose this option, students will receive only the
feedback, "Your instructor will evaluate your response."
</li></ul>

</li><li>Under the 
<span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab, select <span class="link">Create 
exam IDs</span>.  Enter a number slightly greater than the number of students 
who will be taking the exam.  
(You can skip this step if  you choose to use a course password and proctors 
will enter the password that allows students to enter the exam course.)
</li>
<li>Special situations:<ul>
<li>If you are going to offer the exam at more than one time, create enough exam
IDs in each course for the number of students who will be taking the exam at
that time.</li>
<li>If you are going to allow students to log themselves
into the accounts, then choose the option to make the passwords 
identical to the login IDs.
Export the enrollment list to a spreadsheet and print the login IDs on
slips of paper to distribute to students.</li>
<li>If you or proctors are going to log students into their accounts 
yourselves, choose 
the option to make the passwords different from the login IDs. Copy and 
save the login IDs and corresponding
passwords; you will not have another opportunity to see the passwords, and 
only the ACE administrator has the ability to change the passwords.  Assign 
each login ID to a student.  </li>
</ul>


</li></ol>

<h4>Starting the exam</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you are allowing students to log into ACE themselves, and you are
using exam IDs:
<ol>
<li>Give one slip of paper bearing a random login ID to each student about 
to take the exam.  Tell the students that the password is identical to the 
login ID.  Some students will disregard instructions and use their regular login
IDs or passwords.  When they call for help, explain that they have failed to follow
instructions. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Take care that you do not give two students the
same exam ID, or unfunny hilarity will ensue.

</li><li>Instruct students to press
<span class="link">My profile</span> after they log in and change the student 
name and student ID number associated with the random login ID to their own.  
(They may change the password, as well.)  Some students will disregard these
instructions as well.  

</li><li>Instruct students to print
and sign their names on their slips of paper and return them to you as they leave.   
This step will allow you to identify students who did not enter their name and
student ID number in <span class="link">My profile</span>.  The signature will 
also help you identify ringers, if you suspect any.  

</li></ol>
</li>
<li>If you or proctors are logging the students into ACE, and you are using exam IDs:

<ol>
<li>Take control of the students' desktops, and log them into the exam account.

</li><li>Return desktop control to the students, and instruct them to press
<span class="link">My profile</span> and change the student 
name and student ID number associated with the random login ID to their own.  
Some students will disregard these instructions.

<ul><li>Students will not be able to change their passwords, so if they log out during the
exam, you will have to log them back in again.
</li></ul>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>If you are not using exam IDs:

<ol>
<li>Allow students to log into their own accounts.</li>
<li>Take control of the students' 
desktops, and log them into the exam course.

<ul><li>Students will not know the course password, so if they log out during the
exam, you will have to log them back in again.
</li></ul>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>In any case: 
<ol>
<li>Remind students that they are responsible for submitting
saved-but-unsubmitted responses before they leave the exam.  If a student has saved
but not submitted a response to any assignment in the course, ACE provides a button
on the assignment list page that allows the student to submit all such responses
at one time.  <b>Note</b>: The button works even after the exam has ended.

</li><li>When you are ready to begin the exam, press
<span class="link">My courses</span>, press 
<img src="../images/editButton.gif" alt="the edit icon"/> to the right of the exam
course, check the box that enables the course, and save the change.  Students who
have already logged into ACE will need to press <span class="link">Refresh</span>
on the course list page (user home page) to see the exam course.

</li></ol>
</li></ul>

<h4>During the exam</h4>

<ol>

<li>ACE includes on the questions list page and the question-solving page
a clock that counts down to each student's exam end time, so you do not 
need to announce how much time is left in the exam.  However, this clock
may stop when the focus is taken away from the browser, then restart 
when the focus returns to the browser, so it may indicate that the 
student has more time than she actually has. The solution is to refresh the
browser page after returning the focus to it.

</li><li>If any student has technical trouble, you can grant that student an
extension on all assignments without having to edit each assignment 
individually.   Press <span class="link">Edit exam features</span> on the 
assignments list page, click <span class="link">Extensions</span>, enter the
length of the extension (in minutes) next to the name of the appropriate 
student, and submit the change.  ACE will overwrite all extensions 
on individual assignments with the information that you enter this way.  
You can also use this button to change the due time of
all exam assignments for the whole class.  A student's extension will 
take effect after he or she returns to the assignments list page.  

</li><li>If a student "wastes" an attempt because of a technical glitch, 
you can reset the number of attempts.  Press the <span class="link">Grade
Book</span> tab, click on the assignment number, click on the name of the 
student, click <span class="link">alter</span> under the appropriate 
question, change the number of
attempts, and press <span class="link">Alter this record now</span>.

</li></ol>

<h4>After the exam</h4>

<ol>
<li>If you did not use a course password, 
press <span class="link">My courses</span>, press 
<img src="../images/editButton.gif" alt="the edit icon"/> to the 
right of the exam course, and disable the course again.

</li><li>If you chose to tell ACE to omit calculated products 
from feedback to responses to synthesis questions, 
press <span class="link">My courses</span>, press 
<img src="../images/editButton.gif" alt="the edit icon"/> to the 
right of the exam course, and uncheck the box next to "Hide 
calculated synthesis products?"  When you save the changes,
ACE will allow all students registered in this course to see
the calculated synthesis products again.

</li><li>Press the <span class="link">Grade Book</span> tab.
If you see a student named ZZZRandomStudent who has submitted 
responses to the exam, it means that a student who took the exam failed to 
press <span class="link">My profile</span> and enter his or her 
correct name and student ID number.  
The first name of ZZZRandomStudent is the login ID of that student, so you can 
find the student's name either by finding the slip of paper that you collected 
after the exam that bears that random login ID, or from your list assigning
login IDs to students.  
The absence of the correct name and student ID number makes transferring the 
student's work from the random login ID to the regular login ID a little 
more cumbersome, but you can still do it.
Nevertheless, you may want to login under the random login ID and change the 
student's name and student ID number yourself, or you may want to email the 
student and request that she do it herself.  

</li><li>Click on the number of any assignment that shows
<span style="color:gray;"><b>???</b></span> for ungraded questions.

<ul>
<li>If you chose to delay grading on the assignment, press the 
<span class="link">Regrade all</span> button to grade all of the questions 
in the assignment.  ACE will turn off the assignment's 
"delay grading" flag when the regrading is complete so that students
can see the feedback to their responses. You can regrade individual 
questions by choosing the question number from the pulldown menu
next to <span class="link">Regrade</span>.

</li><li>If any questions remain that require you to grade them manually, 
press <span class="link">Hide names</span> to make the students anonymous,   
and click on a student ID number.  Click <span class="link">alter</span> under 
a question that requires grading, read the response, and enter a grade between 
0 and 1.  Enter a comment on the student's response if you wish, and press 
<span class="link">Alter this record now</span>.  ACE will apply the question- 
and attempt-dependent grading parameters for that assignment to the grade 
that you enter.  Repeat for each student.  
</li></ul>

</li><li>You can comment on any student's response to a question.  In the 
gradebook for the assignment containing the question, click on the student's 
name, and click the <span class="link">alter</span> link under the appropriate
question.  Enter your comment in the text box, and press
<span class="link">Alter this record now</span>.  ACE will append your comment 
to the response feedback on the student's problem-solving page and will also 
display it if the student looks at his or her last response in the gradebook.

</li><li>If you have used exam IDs, then, under the 
<span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab, choose 
<span class="link">Transfer exam 
work</span>.  Choose the regular course in which the students are enrolled with
their regular login IDs and passwords, and choose whether you want ACE to use 
names, student ID numbers, or both to match enrollees 
in the exam course to enrollees in the regular ACE course.  ACE will match as 
many students as it can, and, if you approve of the matches, it 
will then transfer the students' work from 
their random login IDs to their regular login IDs.  If any random login 
IDs remain unmatched, for example because of typographical errors, ACE will allow 
you to match them up manually.  ACE will also ask your permission to delete any 
unused random login IDs.  

</li><li>Export the grades as a spreadsheet.

</li><li>Press <span class="link">My courses</span>, press 
<img src="../images/editButton.gif" alt="the edit icon"/> 
to the right of the exam course, and enable the course again (or delete
the course password).  Students will now 
be able to log in with their usual login IDs and see their exam results.  

</li></ol>

<h4>Miscellaneous comments</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you have chosen to store <i>all</i> responses to exam questions in the 
database, you can see a student's earlier 
responses to a question in the detailed gradebook: simply press the 
<span class="link">attempt</span> or <span class="link">alter</span> link and 
choose a response number from the pulldown menu in the popup window.  Please 
note that this method will not allow you to view responses that were saved 
but not submitted.  If you want to view those responses as well, use the link
discussed below.  </li>

<li>On the assignments list page, links to two downloadable files follow each
exam assignment.
<ul><li>The first link is to a table of all student responses to each 
question in the assignment.  The table lists the student name, 
the number of the question in the assignment, the question ID number,
the response number, the time of the response, the IP address of the computer 
from which the response was entered, and the response string.  You may 
use this file to look at students' responses to questions prior to their final 
responses, including responses that they saved without submitting.  The 
information may be useful for verifying student claims of a correct response 
being marked wrong, for catching copiers, etc.  ACE makes this table available 
to you regardless of whether you chose to save every response to the database.
You may save the table and open it in a spreadsheet or word-processing program.
(We do not recommend Microsoft Excel, as it starts new lines at return 
characters in the response strings.)
</li><li>The second link is to a table of all student entries 
into the exam course, including student name, host and IP address, 
and time of login.  You may use this file to verify that no 
one logged into the exam from an unauthorized location.
