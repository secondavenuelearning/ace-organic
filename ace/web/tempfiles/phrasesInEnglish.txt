-989239479	A linear mechanism may not have electron-flow arrows in its last step.
-396746805	A mastery assignment requires that a student answer correctly every question in an assignment before ACE considers the assignment to be mastered. If a student submits the correct response within the number of attempts specified by the instructor, then the student has mastered the question. If a student fails to master a question, the student is permitted to continue to work on it (with no limit on the number of tries), or the student can press the Solve related button to reinstantiate the question. So that ACE can reinstantiate a question, a mastery assignment may contain only randomized questions and R-group questions. When ACE reinstantiates an R group question, it sets the student's assigned R groups to new values; when it reinstantiates a randomized question, ACE assigns a new question at random from the appropriate question group.

If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
