qdText	1	2	HBr
qdText	1	3	H2S
qdText	2	1	H2O
qdText	2	2	HCl
qdText	2	3	H2S
evalFeedback	2	3	Good!  Acidity decreases as you go to the left and up in the periodic table.
qdText	3	1	CH3OH
qdText	3	2	CH3PH2
qdText	3	3	CH3SH
evalFeedback	3	3	You're right that CH3SH is the most acidic.  Although it's difficult to compare CH3PH2 and CH3OH directly, it happens that electronegativity (which favors CH3OH) is more important to acidity than size (which favors CH3PH2) when making a diagonal comparison such as this one.
qdText	4	2	isopropylsilane
evalFeedback	4	3	Good!  Acidity increases from left to right and down the periodic table.  Although Si and O can't be compared directly by looking at periodic trends, O is much, much more acidic.
evalFeedback	4	4	Even though Si is in the row below O, it's also two columns earlier, which makes it much less acidic.
qdText	5	1	CH3NH2
qdText	5	2	CH3OH
qdText	5	3	CH3OH2^+
evalFeedback	5	1	What is the effect of charge on acidity?
evalFeedback	5	2	How does acidity change as you move to the right in the periodic table?
evalFeedback	5	3	Good!  CH3OH is more acidic than CH3NH2 because it is further right in the periodic table, and CH3OH2^+ is more acidic than CH3OH because it has a positive charge.
qdText	6	1	PhCH3
qdText	6	2	Ph2CH2
qdText	6	3	Ph3CH
evalFeedback	6	1	Does the Ph group stabilize or destabilize a pair of electrons in the benzylic position?  So, what is the effect of the Ph group on the ability of C to give up a proton?
evalFeedback	6	2	Good!  The more Ph groups, the more delocalized the lone pair in the conjugate base, and the more acidic the starting compound is.
evalFeedback	6	3	The effect of each Ph group is additive to the previous ones.
qdText	7	1	piperidinium
qdText	7	2	isobutyronitrilium
qdText	7	3	2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridinium

evalFeedback	7	2	Which N atom will give the highest-energy lone pair upon removal of H^+ from the N atom?  It will be least acidic.
evalFeedback	7	3	Good!  Acidity decreases with increasing p character of the #sigma bonds of the acidic atom.
qdText	8	1	valeric acid
qdText	8	2	2-methylbutanoic acid
qdText	8	3	pivalic acid
evalFeedback	8	1	What is the effect of steric crowding on acidity?
evalFeedback	8	2	Good!  The more crowded the acid, the less acidic it is.
qdText	9	1	2-bromobutanoic acid
qdText	9	2	2-chlorobutanoic acid
qdText	9	3	2-hydroxybutanoic acid
qdText	9	4	butanoic acid
evalFeedback	9	1	It is true that HBr is more acidic than HCl, but this fact is not relevant here, because Br and Cl are not the acidic atoms.  In this case, a factor other than size is operating.
evalFeedback	9	2	Good!  The more electronegative the nearby substituent, the greater the acidity of the carboxylic acid.
evalFeedback	9	3	Good!  The more electronegative the nearby substituent, the greater the acidity of the carboxylic acid.
evalFeedback	9	4	What feature of the 2-substituent will influence the acidity of the carboxylic acid?
qdText	10	1	methyl acetate
qdText	10	2	N,N-dimethylacetamide
qdText	10	3	acetaldehyde
evalFeedback	10	1	Which of these carbonyl compounds is lowest in energy?  It is least likely to give up a proton to become an enolate.
evalFeedback	10	2	Which of these carbonyl compounds is highest in energy?  It is most likely to give up a proton to become an enolate.
evalFeedback	10	3	Good!  Amides are lower in energy than esters, which are lower in energy than aldehydes, so the compounds increase in acidity in that order.
qdText	11	1	neohexene
qdText	11	2	t-butylacetylene
qdText	11	3	di-t-butylacetylene
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  The internal alkyne has only C(sp3)-H bonds, so it is least acidic; the alkene has a C(sp2)-H bond; and the terminal alkyne has a C(sp)-H bond, so it is most acidic.
evalFeedback	11	2	An alkyne is particularly acidic only if it is terminal.  Internal alkynes are no more acidic than other hydrocarbons.
evalFeedback	11	3	A terminal alkyne is a particularly acidic hydrocarbon.  Deprotonation of C(sp) leaves behind a lone pair that is in an orbital (sp) with particularly high s character and therefore that is particularly low in energy.
qdText	12	1	chloroacetone
qdText	12	2	fluoroacetone
qdText	12	3	methylmercaptoacetone
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  The more electronegative the substituent, the more acidic the ketone.
evalFeedback	12	2	The size of Cl makes it a better acid only when the Cl is the atom giving up the proton.  What other difference among F, Cl, and MeS is there?
evalFeedback	12	3	What property of a Cl substituent would affect the acidity of the ketone differently from the MeS substituent?
qdText	13	1	2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide
qdText	13	2	piperidide
qdText	13	3	amide
evalFeedback	13	1	Good!  The more sterically hindered the base, the more basic it is, all other factors being equal.
evalFeedback	13	2	How do these compounds differ?  How does that difference affect basicity?
qdText	14	1	2,3-dimethylbutene
qdText	14	2	N-isopropylidenemethylamine
qdText	14	3	acetone

evalFeedback	14	2	Upon deprotonation, which compound can enjoy the most resonance stabilization?
evalFeedback	14	3	Upon deprotonation, which compound enjoys the least resonance stabilization?
qdText	15	1	ethoxide
qdText	15	2	phenoxide
qdText	15	3	t-butoxide
evalFeedback	15	1	Good!  Resonance stabilization of the negative charge makes phenoxide the least basic, and steric hindrance makes <i>t</i>-butoxide more basic than ethoxide.
evalFeedback	15	2	When comparing identical atoms with identical charges, what is the most important factor affecting basicity?  How would that factor affect one of these compounds differently from the other two?
evalFeedback	15	3	How do ethoxide and <i>t</i>-butoxide differ?  What effect does this difference have on basicity?
qdText	16	1	cyclopentadiene
qdText	16	2	indene
qdText	16	3	benzo[a]cycloheptatriene
evalFeedback	16	1	Which compound would become antiaromatic after deprotonation?  How would its acidity rank compared to the other two compounds?
evalFeedback	16	2	Which compound would give a conjugate base some of whose resonance structures would cause benzene aromaticity to be disrupted?  How would this disruption affect the acidity of this compound compared to the compound in which aromaticity is not disrupted?
evalFeedback	16	3	Good!  The cycloheptatriene is least acidic because it has an antiaromatic conjugate base. Both indene and cyclopentadiene are quite acidic, but indene is not as acidic as cyclopentadiene because the conjugate base of indene has some resonance forms in which the benzene aromaticity is disrupted.
qdText	17	1	2-adamantanone
qdText	17	2	bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one
qdText	17	3	bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-en-2-one
evalFeedback	17	1	Deprotonation of the C atom adjacent to the carbonyl C atom gives a carbanion that can't participate in resonance with the carbonyl group due to geomatric restrictions.  The orbital containing the lone pair is restricted to be vertical and in the plane of the screen, whereas the p orbitals of the C=O #pi bond are perpendicular to the plane of the screen.  As a result, there is no resonance stabilization of this compound's conjugate base, so it is not the most acidic among the three.
evalFeedback	17	2	Deprotonation of <i>either</i> the C(sp3) atom <i>or</i> the C(sp2) atom adjacent to the carbonyl C atom gives a carbanion that can't participate in resonance with the carbonyl group due to geomatric restrictions.  The orbital containing the lone pair is restricted to be vertical and in the plane of the screen, whereas the p orbitals of the C=O #pi bond are perpendicular to the plane of the screen.  As a result, there can be no resonance stabilization of the conjugate base of this compound, so it is not very acidic.
evalFeedback	17	3	Good!  Deprotonation of the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl C atom gives a carbanion that can participate in resonance with the carbonyl group.  The other two compounds have conjugate bases whose lone pairs cannot participate in resonance with the carbonyl group due to geometric restrictions.
qdText	18	1	4-nitrophenol
qdText	18	2	3-nitrophenol
qdText	18	3	4-nitro-4-methylcyclohexanol
evalFeedback	18	1	Which compound gives no resonance stabilization of the anion obtained after deprotonating the OH group?
evalFeedback	18	2	Which compound would give a conjugate base some of whose resonance structures would cause benzene aromaticity to be disrupted?  How would this disruption affect the acidity of this compound compared to the compound in which aromaticity is not disrupted?
evalFeedback	18	3	Good!  The nonaromatic alcohol is least acidic because it cannot delocalize the negative charge of the conjugate base. 4-Nitrophenol is more acidic than 3-nitrophenol because the negative charge of the conjugate base of the former compound can be delocalized into the nitro group.
qStmt	19		Ansaid and Motrin belong to a the group of drugs known as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Both are only slightly soluble in water, but one is a little more soluble than the other. Which of the drugs has the greater solubility in water?
qdText	19	1	Ansaid
qdText	19	2	Motrin
evalFeedback	19	1	Good!  Motrin has a smaller hydrophobic portion than does Ansaid.  The F atom of Ansaid does not have much effect on solubility.
evalFeedback	19	2	The F atom does not have much effect on solubility. Which compound has a larger hydrophobic portion?

evalFeedback	3	1	Good.  The C atom adjacent to the carbonyl C is made very acidic by resonance of the conjugate base with the carbonyl group.  The carbonyl C of the aldehyde is not at all acidic because the conjugate base cannot be stabilized by resonance.

evalFeedback	3	3	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?

evalFeedback	3	6	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.

evalFeedback	4	4	This atom doesn't bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	4	5	C(sp2) atoms are generally more acidic than C(sp3) atoms, other things (charge and resonance stabilization of the conjugate base) being equal.  However, in this compound, there are C(sp3) atoms that, upon deprotonation, give a resonance-stabilized conjugate base, so they are more acidic.
evalFeedback	4	6	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good.  An O atom whose conjugate base is resonance-stabilized will always be more acidic than a C atom whose conjugate base is resonance-stabilized.
evalFeedback	5	2	Although the conjugate base of this atom is resonance stabilized, there is a more electronegative atom whose conjugate base is also resonance-stabilized.
evalFeedback	5	3	This atom doesn't bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	5	4	C(sp2) atoms are generally more acidic than C(sp3) atoms, other things (charge and resonance stabilization of the conjugate base) being equal.  However, in this compound, there are atoms that, upon deprotonation, give a resonance-stabilized conjugate base, so they are more acidic.
evalFeedback	5	5	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good.  Either C atom adjacent to the C(sp2) is made acidic by resonance delocalization of the conjugate base's lone pair onto the electronegative N atom.
evalFeedback	6	2	The conjugate base produced by removing a proton from this atom is stabilized by resonance, but the resonance structure also has a C^-.  Deprotonation of a different atom gives a conjugate base that has a better resonance structure.
evalFeedback	6	3	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	6	4	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good.  The most acidic element is furthest to the right and lowest in the periodic table.
evalFeedback	7	2	When comparing elements in the same row of the periodic table, electronegativity matters.  Which is more electronegative, S or P?
evalFeedback	7	3	When comparing elements in the same column of the periodic table, size matters.  Which is larger, O or S?
evalFeedback	7	4	When comparing elements in the same row of the periodic table, electronegativity matters.  Which is more electronegative, O or C?
evalFeedback	7	5	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good.  The C atom between the two carbonyl C atoms is made very acidic by resonance of the conjugate base with both carbonyl groups.
evalFeedback	8	2	The conjugate base produced by removing a proton from this atom is stabilized by resonance with one carbonyl group, but removal of a proton from a different C atom gives a conjugate base even more strongly stabilized.
evalFeedback	8	3	The conjugate base produced by removing a proton from this atom is not stabilized in any way.  There is a more acidic atom.
evalFeedback	8	4	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	8	5	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good.  An O atom whose conjugate base is resonance-stabilized will always be more acidic than a C atom whose conjugate base is resonance-stabilized.
evalFeedback	9	2	Although the conjugate base of this atom is resonance stabilized, there is a more electronegative atom whose conjugate base is also resonance-stabilized.

evalFeedback	10	1	Good.  The C atom adjacent to the carbonyl C is made very acidic by resonance of the conjugate base with the carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	10	2	The conjugate base produced by removing a proton from this atom is not stabilized in any way.  There is a more acidic atom.
evalFeedback	10	3	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	10	4	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good.  Simple alkynes are an exception to the general rule that you consider resonance stabilization before hybridization.  The amount of resonance stabilization obtained upon deprotonation of the CH2 group is fairly small (ca. 8 p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> units), because the lone pair can be localized only on C atoms, and the amount of stabilization of a lone pair provided by placing it in an sp orbital is quite large (ca. 20 p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> units), so the terminal C(sp) in this compound is most acidic.
evalFeedback	11	2	Although the conjugate base obtained upon deprotonating this atom is slightly stabilized by resonance, another atom in this compound is more acidic.
evalFeedback	11	3	Deprotonating this C does not give a conjugate base that is stabilized in any way.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	11	4	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	11	5	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good.  An O atom will always be more acidic than a C atom, all other things being equal.
evalFeedback	12	2	There is a more acidic atom in this compound.
evalFeedback	12	3	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good.  The C atom near the CF3 groups is made more acidic by their electron-withdrawing power.  The increased steric bulk is not an issue, given the large inductive effect.
evalFeedback	13	2	Although this C is less sterically encumbered than the C on the other side of the carbonyl, a factor other than steric encumbrance is more important in this compound.
evalFeedback	13	3	This atom does not bear an H atom.  How can it be acidic?
evalFeedback	13	4	Please label a single, non-H atom with map number 1.
Topic: Acidity and basicity; Set: Label the most basic atom
header			Select (highlight) the most basic atom of the compound, and submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!
evalFeedback	1	2	Right!  More resonance structures can be drawn when this N is protonated than when the other ring N is protonated.  Also, protonation of the other ring N destroys the aromaticity of the ring.
evalFeedback	1	3	Protonation of this N atom destroys the aromaticity of the ring.
evalFeedback	1	4	There are no available lone pairs on this N to donate, so it is not basic.

qdText	1	4	compound 4
qdText	1	5	compound 5
qdText	1	6	compound 6
qdText	1	7	compound 7
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! Highly electronegative  oxygen is able to keep a full negative charge making it a stable base . There is no resonance interactions  and the cyclohexyl ring is electron donating making it a good nucleophile .
evalFeedback	1	2	A base or a nucleophile should be an electron pair donor . An electrophile is an electron deficient specie
evalFeedback	1	3	An acid is a proton donor but a base or a nucleophile accepts protons to form a stable conjugate acid.
evalFeedback	1	4	Negative charge on the oxygen is involved in resonance interactions with pi-electrons on the benzene ring. Resonance stabilization reduces when the oxygen is protonated . Negative charge locallization in the oxygen is reduced due to resonance and electron withdrawing nature of the benzene ring causing decreased nucleophilicity
evalFeedback	1	5	The alcohol is a stable compound. Protonating the oxygen forms a conjugate acid with net positive charge on the oxygen .This specie is less stable than the alcohol .The oxygen has a stable octet therefore use of its electron pair in a nucleophilic attack results in a net positive on the oxygen, lowering its stability .
evalFeedback	1	6	The negative charge on the oxygen is involved in resonance interaction with the carbonyl oxygen . Resonance interactions as well as stability is reduced when the  oxygen is protonated or is involved in a nucleophilic attack to form a new bond .

evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  The compound with the carbonyl group that is most tied up in resonance has to give up the most resonance stabilization to stabilize the carbanionic conjugate base.
evalFeedback	10	2	No, acetaldehyde is not the weakest acid.  When any of the three compounds is deprotonated, the resulting carbanion must be stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl group.

evalFeedback	10	5	Ketones are reduced by LiAlH4.
evalFeedback	10	6	Esters are reduced by LiAlH4.
evalFeedback	10	7	An aldehyde is an intermediate in the reduction of an ester, but it is even more reactive toward LiAlH4 than the starting material, so it reacts further.

evalFeedback	10	10	The OMe group acts as a leaving group in this reaction.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  The reaction sequence results in Markovnikov addition of H-OH across the C=C bond.
evalFeedback	11	2	Remember Markovnikov's rule. H2O is the nucleophile in this reaction, so to which C does the OH attach?
evalFeedback	11	3	No, OsO4 is the reagent that is used to produce 1,2-diols.  Try again.
evalFeedback	11	4	The intermediate in this reaction contains Hg, but the purpose of the NaBH4 is to replace the Hg atom with another atom.
evalFeedback	11	5	The NaBH4 is a reducing agent, delivering H to the intermediate in this reaction. B is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	11	6	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	11	7	The alkene reacts with the reagents to give a product that is not an alkene.

evalFeedback	11	10	The product is an alcohol.
evalFeedback	11	11	The product contains only one O atom.
evalFeedback	11	12	The OH group in the product should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene in the starting material.
evalFeedback	12	1	That's right!  Anti-Markovnikov addition of H2O across the double bond occurs.
evalFeedback	12	2	Yes, the product is an alcohol, but not this one. In the addition of borane to the alkene, does B or H act as the electrophile? In the second step, the boron is replaced by OH.
evalFeedback	12	3	No, a diol is produced by addition of OsO4, not by this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	4	The B in the intermediate is replaced with another group in the final product. (That is the purpose of adding H2O2 and HO^-.)
evalFeedback	12	5	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	6	Which C atoms of the starting material are most reactive? The OH should be attached to one of them.
evalFeedback	12	7	The product is not an ether.  THF is simply a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	8	You have drawn a hydroperoxide (has an OOH group). This reaction does not produce hydroperoxides. What functional group looks like a hydroperoxide but is much more common?
evalFeedback	12	9	Look at the second set of conditions.  What functional group is likely to be present in the product?

evalFeedback	13	3	Please specify the configuration at both stereocenters.

evalFeedback	22	1	Right!  The Lucas reagent, ZnCl2 and HCl, converts alcohols into chlorides under SN1 conditions, so the configuration of the OH-bearing stereocenter is scrambled in the product.
evalFeedback	22	2	Your answer is almost correct, but retention of configuration at the OH-bearing C does not occur.  The Lucas reagent, ZnCl2 and HCl, converts alcohols into chlorides under very strongly acidic conditions.  What will happen to the stereochemistry of the C bearing the leaving group?
evalFeedback	22	3	Your answer is almost correct, but inversion of configuration at the OH-bearing C does not occur.  The Lucas reagent, ZnCl2 and HCl, converts alcohols into chlorides under very strongly acidic conditions.  What will happen to the stereochemistry of the C bearing the leaving group?

evalFeedback	5	2	Not a bad answer, but not the one we're expecting.  Assume that the reaction mixture is dilute enough that two alcohols are unlikely to encounter one another.
evalFeedback	5	3	You're close!  Loss of OH to give a primary carbocation is followed by a 1,2-hydride shift so that a more stable carbocation is formed. Loss of H^+ then occurs to give the lowest-energy alkene.  Can you think of an alkene lower in energy than the one you have drawn?

evalFeedback	7	1	Excellent! The secondary carbocation formed up loss of OH rearranges by a 1,2-methyl shift to a more stable tertiary carbocation, and a proton is then lost from the adjacent C bonded to the fewest hydrogens (Zaitsev's rule).
evalFeedback	7	2	Your answer is quite reasonable, but the compound you draw will probably not be the major product.  Loss of OH gives a carbocation which can undergo what typical reaction other than just loss of H^+ from a neighboring C?
evalFeedback	7	3	After the tertiary carbocation forms, which C will lose H^+ to give the product alkene?  Think Zaitsev's rule.

evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw a single organic molecule.
evalFeedback	8	5	H2SO4 merely acts as an acid catalyst in the reaction.  It donates H^+ and converts OH into a good leaving group.  Hence it is not incorporated into the final product.

evalFeedback	11	1	Correct! This compounds reacts with Na, eliminating H2 gas (bubbles); the double bond reacts with Br2, decolorizing the solution; the alcohol group is oxidized with chromic acid; and only a primary alcohol, not allylic, gives a positive Lucas test.

evalFeedback	12	1	Very good! No alcohol or double bond is present in the compound because it gives no reaction in all four chemical tests.  Because the compound has one degree of unsaturation, it must be cyclic, and because it has an O atom but no alcohol, it must be an ether.
evalFeedback	12	2	The molecular formula of <b>X</b> is C4H8O. Count your atoms.
evalFeedback	12	3	Compound <b>Y</b> does not react with bromine, so it cannot contain a double bond.

evalFeedback	13	11	The nucleophilic atom makes a bond to the C that bears the leaving group, and the leaving group leaves.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	14		Give the product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	14	1	Excellent!  The tosylate ester is a great leaving group, and is ready for displacement by a good nucleophile; in this case, iodide.  A classic SN2 reaction takes place to give you inversion of stereochemistry--what was (S) to begin with is now (R).
evalFeedback	14	2	Please indicate the relative configuration of the stereocenter.
evalFeedback	14	3	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	15	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	15	3	Please draw a single organic molecule.
evalFeedback	15	4	Tosyl chloride converts the alcohol into a good leaving group, so its elements are not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	16	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	16	3	Please draw a single organic molecule.
evalFeedback	16	4	SOCl2 activates the alcohol, transforming it into a good leaving group, but S is not incorporated into the final product.
evalFeedback	16	5	Pyridine acts merely as a weak base to quench the acid by-products of the reaction.  Hence, its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	16	6	OH is converted into a good leaving group with SOCl2, and the O in SOCl2 remains attached to S, so there is no O in the product.

qStmt	17		Give the MAJOR product of the following reaction:
evalFeedback	17	1	Excellent!  After loss of the leaving group and a 1,2-methyl shift to give a lower-energy tertiary carbocation, loss of H^+ occurs to give the most substituted, least sterically hindered alkene.
evalFeedback	17	2	Please draw a single organic molecule.
evalFeedback	17	3	H2SO4 merely acts as an acid catalyst in the reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the final product.
evalFeedback	17	4	OH acts as a leaving group, so it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	17	5	Under acidic conditions, alcohols are electrophiles.  No good nucleophile is present, so what reaction will occur?
evalFeedback	17	6	How will this protonated alcohol avoid forming a primary carbocation?
evalFeedback	17	7	In an elimination reaction, the starting material loses the leaving group and an adjacent H atom.

evalFeedback	2	13	It is unlikely that methylenecyclopentane is an intermediate in this reaction.  Its formation would have to occur either by an E1 mechanism, which would require a 1&deg; carbocation intermediate, or an E2 mechanism, which requires a strong base and so does not occur under acidic conditions.

evalFeedback	43	15	Fantastic!!  This is the pinacol rearrangement.  After protonation of one of the hydroxyl groups, water departs and a ring contraction turns one of the six-membered rings into a five-membered ring--leaving a carbocation which can be stabilized by the oxygen.  deprotonation from the oxygen gives you the ketone product.
qStmt	44		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the following reaction.

evalFeedback	44	6	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 5.
evalFeedback	44	7	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.

Topic: Alkanes: Reactions; Set: Free radical substitutions
header			Draw the major product of the reaction shown.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct!  A H atom is substituted with Br, and the H atom that is removed is the one that gives the lowest energy free radical.  Removal of a H atom from C(^4) gives an allylic radical, one of whose resonance structures is tertiary.
evalFeedback	1	2	Your answer is not unreasonable, and a significant amount of this product may be obtained. However, removal of a different H atom from the starting material gives a lower energy radical, and so another product should be obtained in even greater amounts.
evalFeedback	1	3	Not an unreasonable answer, but there is a more predominant product. The intermediate radical can react with NBS to give a product with a more substituted double bond.
evalFeedback	1	4	There are two products that will predominate over this one. The radical that leads to this product can react with NBS to give different product with a more substituted double bond (lower in energy). Also, removal of a different H atom from the starting material gives a lower energy radical, and so another product should be obtained in even greater amounts.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	6	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	7	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	8	NBS has a very reactive N-Br bond, so the product should contain Br.
evalFeedback	1	9	The only element of NBS that is incorporated into the product is Br.
evalFeedback	1	10	The C skeleton remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	1	11	Although NBS can be used to promote electrophilic additions to C=C bonds, when #light is present, NBS promotes a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	1	12	The #light tells you that this is a free-radical reaction.  Removal of the H from C(sp2) does not give a low-energy radical--in fact, the C(sp2) radical is quite high in energy because the hybrid orbital that is now half-empty has a lot of s character.  Removal of a H atom from which C atom will give a lower energy radical?
evalFeedback	1	13	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  When the allylic H is removed, the resulting radical is present at two C atoms due to resonance.  The Br atom can attach to either one, but it attaches to the one that gives the lower energy (more substituted, trans) alkene.
evalFeedback	2	2	Not an unreasonable answer, but there is a more predominant product. The intermediate radical can react with Br2 to give a product with a more substituted double bond. Draw a resonance structure of the intermediate radical to see where else the Br can attach itself.
evalFeedback	2	3	Close, but there is a lower-energy product.  (Think stereochemistry.)
evalFeedback	2	4	Please specify the stereochemistry about the double bond.
evalFeedback	2	5	This would be the product in the absence of light.  In the presence of light, however, C-H substitution occurs instead of electrophilic addition.
evalFeedback	2	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	7	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	2	8	Look at the reagent.  Shouldn't your product incorporate Br atoms?
evalFeedback	2	9	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	10	The C skeleton remains unchanged.

evalFeedback	2	12	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	2	13	Under these free radical conditions, which bond can cleave to give the lowest-energy radical?

evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	4	The correct answer doesn't incorporate more than one Cl atom.
evalFeedback	3	5	The product should contain Cl.
evalFeedback	3	6	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	7	In this substitution reaction, only one H atom is replaced with Cl.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  The H atom on C(sp3) adjacent to the C=C bond is selectively removed because it gives a resonance-stabilized radical, and that radical then acquires a Br atom.
evalFeedback	4	2	The H atom that is removed in free-radical substitutions is the one whose removal leaves behind the most stabilized radical.  In the case of alkenes, the most stabilized radical is the one on C(sp3) adjacent to the C=C bond (due to resonance).
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a single, organic product.

evalFeedback	4	8	The product should incorporate a Br atom from the NBS.
evalFeedback	4	9	Although NBS can promote electrophilic additions to C=C bonds, when #light is present, it participates in a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	4	10	Neither a change in the number of C atoms nor a skeletal rearrangement is likely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	4	11	Only one H atom is substituted with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
qStmt	5		NBS = <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Removal of the benzylic H gives the most stable radical, so the benzylic C acquires the Br atom.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	5	4	CCl4 is merely a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	5	The only reagent in this reaction that has N or O is NBS, and the succinimide portion of NBS is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	6	The purpose in life of NBS is to incorporate Br into the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	7	Only one equivalent of NBS is added.
evalFeedback	5	8	The benzene ring is preserved in this reaction (and many others) because its aromaticity makes it very low in energy.

evalFeedback	5	10	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	5	11	The H atom that is replaced in free-radical brominations of alkylbenzenes is the one whose removal provides the lowest-energy radical.
qStmt	6		NBS = <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  Removal of the H atom from C(^3) gives a radical that is allylic and tertiary.  The radical is localized on both C(^1) and C(^3), so it attaches to the C atom that will result in the formation of the lower energy (more substituted) alkene.
evalFeedback	6	2	Your answer is not unreasonable, but there is a better answer. The removal of which H atom from the starting material will lead to the lowest energy radical?
evalFeedback	6	3	Your answer is not unreasonable, but there is a more predominant product. The intermediate radical can acquire a Br atom to give a product with a more substituted double bond. Draw a resonance structure of the intermediate radical to see where else the Br can attach itself.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	6	6	CCl4 is merely a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	7	The elements of the succinimide portion of NBS are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	8	Only one equivalent of NBS is used, so the product cannot have more than one Br atom.
evalFeedback	6	9	The purpose in life of NBS is to incorporate Br into a substrate.
evalFeedback	6	10	A skeletal rearrangement or a change in the number of C atoms is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	6	11	Although NBS can promote electrophilic addition to C=C bonds, when #light is present, it participates in a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	6	12	Only one of the H atoms is substituted with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	6	13	In this free-radical reaction, the H atom in the starting material whose removal will give the lowest-energy radical will be replaced with Br.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The Br replaces H on the C atom that can bear the lowest-energy radical.
evalFeedback	7	2	Free radical brominations proceed by removing the H atom that leads to the lowest energy radical.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	Only one atom of Br is incorporated into the product in free-radical brominations.

evalFeedback	7	7	One H atom is replaced with Br.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	8		NBS = <I>N</I>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  The H atom that is removed is the one that gives the allylic, tertiary-tertiary radical, and replacement of this H atom with Br gives the product you have drawn.
evalFeedback	8	2	Your answer is not unreasonable, but removal of a different H atom from the one you chose leads to a lower-energy radical, and this radical will give the major product.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	8	5	CCl4 is merely a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	6	The elements of succinimide are not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	8	8	The purpose in life of NBS is to incorporate Br into an organic compound.
evalFeedback	8	9	Although NBS can promote electrophilic addition to C=C bonds, when a nucleophile is not present, it participates in a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	8	10	A skeletal rearrangement or change in the number of C atoms is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	8	11	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	12	You're on the right track, but there is a better answer. The removal of which H atom from the starting material will lead to the lowest energy radical?
qStmt	9		NBS = <I>N</I>-bromosuccinimide
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  The H atom that is removed is the one that gives a tertiary, allylic-benzylic radical.  Resonance gives the Br atom its choice of two C atoms to which to attach, and it chooses the one that gives the more substituted, more conjugated alkene.
evalFeedback	9	2	Your answer is not unreasonable, but there is a more predominant product. The intermediate radical can react with NBS to give a product with a more substituted and conjugated double bond. Draw a resonance structure of the intermediate radical to see where else the Br can attach itself.
evalFeedback	9	3	Your answer is not unreasonable, but there is a better answer. Removal of another H atom will produce a radical that is lower in energy than the one that leads to the product you drew.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	9	6	CCl4 is merely a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	7	Other than the Br atom, the elements of NBS are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	8	Only one equivalent of NBS is used, so how many Br atoms should the product have?
evalFeedback	9	9	The purpose in life of NBS is to incorporate Br into an organic compound.
evalFeedback	9	10	The benzene ring of the starting material is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	9	11	Although NBS can promote electrophilic addition to C=C bonds, when a nucleophile is not present, it participates in a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	9	12	The C skeleton is unlikely to change in this reaction, and the benzene ring remains unaffected because of its aromaticity.
evalFeedback	9	13	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	9	14	The H atom that is removed is the one that gives the most stable radical.  That means that it is attached to C(sp3), and it is best if it is adjacent to a #pi bond.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  A H atom is replaced with the OOH group, and the H atom that is replaced is on a C(sp3) adjacent to the heteroatom.
evalFeedback	10	2	The H atom that is likely to be removed in this free-radical substitution reaction is the one that will give the lowest-energy radical, and radicals are stabilized by adjacent lone pairs.
evalFeedback	10	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	10	5	The ring structure in the compound remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	10	6	O2 is incorporated into the product, so how many O atoms should the product have?
evalFeedback	10	7	The O-O bond of O2 is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	10	8	Only one H atom is removed from the substrate, and it ends up attached to an O atom.  The other H atoms remain unchanged.
qStmt	11		(This reaction is carried out on a huge scale every year as part of the synthesis of phenol and acetone.)
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  Autoxidation results in the formation of a hydroperoxide.  The C atom that acquires the OOH group is the one that can make the lowest energy radical--in this case, the benzylic C.

evalFeedback	11	3	Please draw a single, organic product.

evalFeedback	11	6	The benzene ring of the starting material is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	11	7	The C skeleton is unlikely to change in this reaction, and the benzene ring will be preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	11	8	Only one H atom is removed from a C atom in this reaction, and it is retained in the product attached to O.
evalFeedback	11	9	The new C-O bond will form at the C atom that is best able to bear a radical.
qStmt	12		NBS = <I>N</I>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	12	1	Right!  Removal of the benzylic H gives the most stable radical, so the benzylic C acquires the Br atom.
evalFeedback	12	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	12	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	12	4	The only reagent in this reaction that has N or O is NBS, and the succinimide portion of NBS is not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	12	10	The H atom that is replaced in free-radical brominations of alkylbenzenes is the one whose removal provides the lowest-energy radical.
qStmt	13		NBS = <I>N</I>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	13	1	Correct!  A H atom is substituted with Br.
evalFeedback	13	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	13	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	13	4	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	5	NBS has a very reactive N-Br bond, so the product should contain Br.
evalFeedback	13	6	The only element of NBS that is incorporated into the product is Br.
evalFeedback	13	7	The C skeleton remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	13	8	Although NBS can be used to promote electrophilic additions to C=C bonds, when #light is present, NBS promotes a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	13	9	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	13	10	In this free-radical reaction, the H will be removed from C(sp3), because that produces the lowest-energy radical.

evalFeedback	14	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	14	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	14	4	Br will be incorporated into the product through a radical mechanism.

evalFeedback	14	8	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	14	9	The H atom that is replaced in free-radical brominations of alkylbenzenes is the one whose removal provides the lowest-energy radical.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  Removal of the benzylic H gives the most stable radical, so the benzylic C acquires the Br atom.
evalFeedback	15	2	Your answer is not unreasonable, but the benzene ring is better at stabilizing a neighboring radical than is an O atom attached to a benzene ring.
evalFeedback	15	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	15	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	15	5	Br will be incorporated into the product through a radical mechanism.

evalFeedback	15	9	A skeletal rearrangement or change in number of C atoms is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	15	10	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	15	11	The methoxy group is inert under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	15	12	The para relationship of the MeO and Me groups remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	15	13	The H atom that is replaced with Br is the one whose removal leads to the most stabilized radical.
qStmt	16		NBS = <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  When the allylic H is removed, the resulting radical is present at two C atoms due to resonance.  The Br atom can attach to either one, but it attaches to the one that gives the lower energy (more substituted, trans) alkene.
evalFeedback	16	2	Not an unreasonable answer, but there is a more predominant product. The intermediate radical can react with Br2 to give a product with a more substituted double bond. Draw a resonance structure of the intermediate radical to see where else the Br can attach itself.
evalFeedback	16	3	Close, but there is a lower-energy product.  (Think stereochemistry.)
evalFeedback	16	4	Please specify the stereochemistry about the double bond.
evalFeedback	16	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	16	6	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	16	7	The succinide portion of NBS is not incorporated into the major product.

evalFeedback	16	9	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	16	10	The C skeleton remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	16	11	Although Br2 can add to C=C bonds, when #light is present, Br2 participates in a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The alkene is preserved in the product.
evalFeedback	16	12	Only one H atom is replaced with Br.  The others remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	16	13	Under these free radical conditions, which bond can cleave to give the lowest-energy radical?
evalFeedback	17	1	Right!  One H atom is replaced with a Cl atom.
evalFeedback	17	2	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	8	1	Right! The two different secondary C atoms will react preferentially because of the stability of the radical intermediates that are formed.
evalFeedback	8	2	You have drawn too many products.  Either you have drawn one product more than once, or you have drawn at least one compound that is not obtained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	3	Although this compound is indeed a major product, it is not the only one formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	4	1-Bromohexane is not a major product of this reaction because its formation requires the intermediacy of a high-energy primary radical.

qStmt	9		Predict the major product of the following reaction. Remember that bromination is highly selective, and that the most stable radical will be formed.

evalFeedback	9	9	Which H can be removed to give the lowest-energy radical?
Topic: Alkanes: Reactions; Set: Yet more free-radical substitutions
header			Draw the major product of the following reaction, ignoring stereoisomers.  If no reaction occurs, draw the starting material.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! Free radical brominations proceed by removing the H atom that leads to the lowest energy radical, which then combines with Br to form the product.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	1	3	No C-C #sigma bonds are broken or made in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	4	Only one atom of Br is incorporated into the product in free-radical brominations.
evalFeedback	1	5	Shouldn't the product contain Br?
evalFeedback	1	6	The product contains only the elements of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	7	This reaction proceeds by a free-radical mechanism.  Removal of which H gives the lowest-energy radical?
evalFeedback	2	1	Good! Alkanes do not react with Cl2 or Br2 to form alkyl chlorides or alkyl bromides.  These halogenation reactions take place only in the presence of light or peroxides or at high temperatures.
evalFeedback	2	2	In the absence of any radical initiators or light, Cl2 does not react with alkanes.
evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	2	4	No C-C #sigma bonds or C-H #sigma bonds are broken or made in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good! Product distribution in radical chlorination depends both on the number of H atoms that can be abstracted that will lead to the formation of a particular product and also the relative rate at which a particular H atom is abstracted.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	3	3	No C-C #sigma bonds are broken or made in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	4	Only one atom of Cl is incorporated into the product in free-radical chlorinations.
evalFeedback	3	5	Shouldn't the product contain Cl?
evalFeedback	3	6	The product contains only the elements of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	3	7	Your answer is not unreasonable, but free-radical chlorinations often do not proceed via the lowest-energy radical.  The Cl radical is fairly indiscriminate in which H atoms it removes.  In this particular compound, there are nine H atoms whose removal would lead to a primary radical, and only one whose removal would lead to a tertiary radical, so the Cl reacts predominantly with the most abundant H atom.
qStmt	4		NBS is N-bromosuccinimide.
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct!  A H atom is substituted with Br, and the H atom that is removed is the one that gives the lowest energy free radical.  Removal of a H atom from C(5) gives a stable allylic radical.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	4	3	Only one atom of Br is incorporated into the product in free-radical brominations.
evalFeedback	4	4	NBS has a very reactive N-Br bond, so the product should contain Br.
evalFeedback	4	5	The only element of NBS that is incorporated into the product is Br.
evalFeedback	4	6	Although NBS can be used to promote electrophilic additions to C=C bonds, when #light is present, NBS promotes a free-radical C-H substitution reaction.  The diene is preserved in the product.

evalFeedback	2	12	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	2	13	Good!  In this free-radical chain mechanism, the initiation involves abstraction of H&middot; from the ether by O2.

evalFeedback	6	7	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	6	8	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	6	9	Good!  This SN1 mechanism begins by dissociation of bromine from the t-butyl compound to form a  stable tertiary carbocation.  Next, the oxygen from solvent methanol attacks the positively charged carbon, generating a protonated ether.  Finally, another solvent molecule deprotonates the charged ether for your final product.

evalFeedback	2	3	The anti conformer is not the lowest energy conformer of this compound.   In what conformation can the OH groups form an intramolecular hydrogen bond? <P>(If you alter your previous response, and you want to remove a group attached to the original two C atoms of the structure, replace it with an H atom; don't erase it.)

evalFeedback	5	2	Good!  A chiral conformer is one that is not superimposable with its mirror image.  Any compound with more than one conformation &mdash; even ethane &mdash; has some chiral conformations, but all a compound needs is one energetically accessible <i>achiral</i> conformation to be considered achiral.
evalFeedback	5	3	This conformer is achiral.  It has a plane of symmetry that contains the four C atoms, and it is identical to its mirror image.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please follow the instructions for drawing this compound.

evalFeedback	6	1	You didn't draw 1,2-dichloroethane.  <P>(If you alter your previous response, and you want to remove a group attached to the original two C atoms of the structure, replace it with an H atom; don't erase it.)
evalFeedback	6	2	Good!  This conformer has a plane of symmetry and is identical to its mirror image.  In fact, even though the compound's lowest energy conformation is chiral, the fact that it has energetically accessible achiral conformations means that the compound is considered achiral.
evalFeedback	6	3	This conformer is chiral, not achiral, because it has no plane of symmetry, and it is not identical to its mirror image.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please follow the instructions for drawing this compound.
qStmt	7		Draw a diagram of energy vs. C-C-C-C dihedral angle in butane.

evalFeedback	7	1	Excellent!  In contrast to ethane, which has only one staggered conformer and one eclipsed conformer, butane has two different staggered conformers, both energy minima (two higher energy and one lower energy), and two different eclipsed conformers, both energy maxima (two lower energy and one higher energy).

evalFeedback	7	10	What are the relative energies of the two gauche conformers?
evalFeedback	7	11	What are the relative energies of the gauche and anti conformers?
evalFeedback	7	12	What are the relative energies of the three eclipsed conformers?
evalFeedback	7	13	You haven't labeled the different energy states correctly.
qStmt	8		Draw a diagram of energy vs. Cl-C-C-H dihedral angle in isobutyl chloride.

evalFeedback	8	1	Excellent!  The staggered isomers in which the Cl is gauche to one CH3 group and anti to the other are lower in energy than the staggered isomer in which the Cl is gauche to both CH3 groups, and the eclipsed isomers in which the C-Cl bond overlaps the C-CH3 bond are higher in energy than the isomer in which the C-Cl bond overlaps the C-H bond.

Follow this procedure:

</li><li>Press the <b>Abbreviated Groups</b> button (first button in southern toolbar), type Et, and press <b>Ok</b>.
</li><li>Click on an H atom to replace that H atom with an Et group.

</li><li>To rotate the structure in 3D (sawhorse projection only), press the <b>3D Rotate</b> button in the northern toolbar. (You may need to scroll the toolbar with the right arrow in the far upper right corner to see it; don't choose the <b>Clean 3D</b> button by mistake.)

qStmt	10		Draw a diagram of energy vs. H-C&#8211;C-CH3 dihedral angle of the C(1)&#8211;C(2) bond in 1,1-dichloropropane.  The first column should show the energy of the conformer of butane with a 0&#176; H-C&#8211;C-CH3 dihedral angle (see figure), the second column should show the energy of the 60&#176; conformer, the third column should show the energy of the 120&#176; conformer, etc.  Label each energy state with the appropriate name (staggered or eclipsed). Note: The cost of a CH3-Cl eclipsing interaction is more than twice the cost of a CH3&#8211;H or Cl-H eclipsing interaction.
evalFeedback	10	1	Excellent!  The staggered isomers in which the CH3 group is gauche to one Cl atom and anti to the other are lower in energy than the staggered isomer in which the CH3 group is gauche to both Cl atoms, and the eclipsed isomers in which a C-Cl bond overlaps the C-CH3 bond are higher in energy than the eclipsed isomer in which the C-Cl and C-CH3 bonds overlap only C-H bonds.
evalFeedback	10	2	Your  maxima and minima have the correct relative energies, but you mislabeled or did not label them as staggered or eclipsed.

evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Think about what nucleophile the intermediate carbocation is most likely to encounter.

evalFeedback	4	9	Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	4	10	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	4	11	To which C atom in the product is the halogen atom likely to be attached?
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The reaction sequence results in Markovnikov addition of H-OH across the C=C bond.
evalFeedback	5	2	Remember Markovnikov's rule. H2O is the nucleophile in this reaction, so to which C does the OH attach?
evalFeedback	5	3	No, OsO4 is the reagent that is used to produce 1,2-diols.  Try again.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw an uncharged product.

evalFeedback	5	12	When H2O acts as a nucleophile, what functional group is present in the product?
evalFeedback	5	13	The product contains only one O atom.
evalFeedback	5	14	The OH group in the product should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene in the starting material.
evalFeedback	6	1	That's right!  Br2 adds across the #pi bond to give a 1,2-dibromide.
evalFeedback	6	2	In the presence of strong light these products may be obtained, but assume this reaction is carried out in the dark. How does the alkene behave toward the electrophilic Br2?
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a single molecule as your response.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	7	1	That's right!  Markovnikov addition takes place to put the OH group on the more substituted C atom and the Br atom on the less substituted one.
evalFeedback	7	2	Yes, this reaction results in addition of Br(-) and HO(-) across the double bond, but with Markovnikov regiochemistry (the nucleophile adds to the C better able to bear a positive charge). Try again.
evalFeedback	7	3	How many bonds does O usually make? What group is lost from OH2 after it makes a bond to the carbocation intermediate?
evalFeedback	7	4	In a different solvent this answer would be correct, but H2O is a nucleophile that participates in the reaction.

evalFeedback	7	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	7	What is the role of the Br2 in this reaction?

evalFeedback	8	2	Yes, this reaction results in addition of Br(-) and CH3O(-) across the double bond, but with Markovnikov regiochemistry (the nucleophile adds to the C better to bear a positive charge). Try again.
evalFeedback	8	3	In a different solvent this would be the right answer, but CH3OH is a nucleophile that participates in the reaction.
evalFeedback	8	4	Presumably you drew an OH group in your product because the solvent is CH3OH. Which bond in CH3OH is more likely to cleave, the C-O bond or the O-H bond? So to which group should the O still be attached when it is incorporated into the product of this reaction?
evalFeedback	8	5	Please draw a single molecule as your product.
evalFeedback	8	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	7	What is the role of the Br2 in this reaction?

evalFeedback	9	1	That's right!  Anti-Markovnikov addition of H2O across the double bond occurs.
evalFeedback	9	2	Yes, the product is an alcohol, but not this one. In the addition of borane to the alkene, does B or H act as the electrophile? In the second step, the boron is replaced by OH.

evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	9	9	Which C atoms of the starting material are most reactive? The OH should be attached to one of them.
evalFeedback	9	10	The product is not an ether.  THF is simply a solvent in this reaction.

evalFeedback	9	12	Look at the second set of conditions.  What functional group is likely to be present in the product?
evalFeedback	10	1	That's right!  H-OH adds across the #pi bond in Markovnikov fashion.

evalFeedback	11	10	Because a tertiary carbocation can be formed, a rearrangement is unlikely.
evalFeedback	12	1	That's right!  Markovnikov addition takes place to put the OH group on the more substituted C atom and the Br atom on the less substituted one.
evalFeedback	12	2	Which atom is the nucleophile?  Obey Markovnikov's rule!
evalFeedback	12	3	If the OH group weren't present in the substrate, this answer would be correct, but the OH group participates in the reaction.

evalFeedback	12	6	What is the role of the Br2 in this reaction?

evalFeedback	12	9	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of HBr.
evalFeedback	12	10	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	12	11	When HO participates in this reaction, it replaces its O-H bond with an O-C bond. So, in the product, O will be bonded to two C atoms.
evalFeedback	13	1	Right!  Br attaches to the C of the alkene that can form the lowest energy carbocation.
evalFeedback	13	2	Well, under certain conditions this could be the major product, but assume that air is excluded from the flask and that the solvent is free of peroxides, and obey Markovnikov's rule.
evalFeedback	13	3	Please draw a single molecule as your product.
evalFeedback	13	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	13	5	Two Br atoms are added when an alkene reacts with Br2, but the reagent here is HBr.
evalFeedback	13	6	The reagent is HBr, so Br is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	7	The Br atom in the product should be attached to one of the more reactive C atoms in the starting material.
evalFeedback	13	8	Count your carbons, please.
evalFeedback	13	9	The benzene ring is inert under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	13	10	Alkenes react with HBr to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	13	11	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur. Also, no C-C bonds are broken or formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  In the presence of peroxides, anti-Markovnikov addition across the #pi bond occurs by a free-radical mechanism.
evalFeedback	14	2	How do peroxides affect the regioselectivity of the reaction? What atom is added first to the double bond? What radical is more stable? Think anti-Markovnikov.
evalFeedback	14	3	More than one Br atom is incorporated into the product when alkenes react with Br2, but not with HBr.
evalFeedback	14	4	The reagent is HBr, so the product should incorporate a Br atom.
evalFeedback	14	5	The Br atom in the product should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene in the starting material.
evalFeedback	14	6	The peroxide is merely a catalyst of this reaction, so O is not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	14	8	The benzene ring is inert under these reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	14	9	Alkenes react with HBr to give a product that is not an alkene.

evalFeedback	15	2	Please use both provided starting materials in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	15	4	No carbocations should be generated under basic reaction conditions such as these.
evalFeedback	15	6	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	15	7	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed reaction arrow.
evalFeedback	15	8	Boxes connected by a double-headed reaction arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	15	9	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.  Addition of EtO^- to the carbonyl group is followed by a 1,2-shift of the Ph group, expelling Br^- to give the product.

evalFeedback	5	9	The Br atom in the product should be attached to a C atom that was part of the #pi bond in the starting material.
qStmt	6		Give the major product obtained from the following reaction:
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  The major product is derived from a 1,2-methyl shift.

evalFeedback	10	5	Please draw only a single starting material.
evalFeedback	10	6	You have drawn an enol, a compound with an OH group attached directly to a C=C bond.  Although hydrogenation of an enol might give you the right product, enols are not stable compounds--they rapidly isomerize to the more stable carbonyl compounds--so your answer is not correct.

evalFeedback	14	6	A dichlorocyclopropane is best made from CCl2 addition to an alkene that lacks Cl.

evalFeedback	15	6	You're close, but you're missing an important detail.  The hydroborating agent is BD3, not BH3, so what atom should be incorporated into the product?
evalFeedback	15	7	The D atom and the OH group add to the adjacent C atoms of the former alkene.
evalFeedback	15	8	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	15	9	Please draw a single organic compound.
evalFeedback	15	10	In hydroboration-oxidation, the B in the intermediate is replaced with OH, so there is no B in the product.
evalFeedback	15	11	The C skeleton is unchanged.
evalFeedback	15	12	The product does not contain the alkene functional group.
evalFeedback	15	13	Only one OH group is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	15	14	What functional group is obtained after a hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene?
evalFeedback	15	15	Yes, the product is an alcohol, but the OH group should be attached to one of the C atoms that was participating in a #pi bond in the starting material.
qStmt	16		Draw the alkene you would use to make the alcohol shown.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  Hydroboration of this alkene will give the alcohol shown by anti-Markovnikov addition of the H and OH groups.
evalFeedback	16	2	Although acid-catalyzed hydration of this alkene would give some of the desired product, lots of by-products derived from rearrangements would be obtained.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	16	3	Please draw only a single starting material.
evalFeedback	16	4	You have drawn an enol, a compound with an OH group attached directly to a C=C bond.  Although hydrogenation of an enol might give you the right product, enols are not stable compounds--they rapidly isomerize to the more stable carbonyl compounds--so your answer is not correct.
evalFeedback	16	5	Please draw an alkene.
evalFeedback	16	6	The O atom in the target alcohol will be introduced by the reagent that converts the alkene into the alcohol.  It will not be present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	16	7	No C-C bonds need be made or broken when an alkene is converted to an alcohol.  Count your C atoms.

evalFeedback	17	3	Please specify the geometry of the alkene (E or Z) by positioning the alkene substituents properly.
evalFeedback	17	4	Please draw only a single starting material.
evalFeedback	17	5	Please draw an alkene.
evalFeedback	17	6	If the proper diastereomer is to be obtained, the OMe and the Br groups should be introduced in a single reaction.  As a result, the starting alkene will lack both of these groups.
evalFeedback	17	7	No C-C bonds need be made or broken when a bromoalcohol is made from an alkene.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	17	8	The starting alkene should have its C=C bond between the C atoms that bear the Br and OMe groups in the product.

evalFeedback	18	1	Right!  Anti addition of Cl2 across the C=C bond of this alkene will provide the target compound.

evalFeedback	18	8	The starting alkene should have its C=C bond between the C atoms that bear the Cl atoms in the product.
qStmt	19		Draw the alkene that could be used to make the dichloride shown.
evalFeedback	19	1	Right!  Anti addition of Cl2 across the C=C bond of this alkene will provide the target compound.
evalFeedback	19	2	Anti addition of Cl2 across the C=C bond of this alkene will give the diastereomer of the desired dichloride.  What diastereomer of the alkene is needed so that anti addition of Cl2 will give the correct diastereomer?
evalFeedback	19	3	Please specify the geometry of the alkene (E or Z) by positioning the alkene substituents properly.
evalFeedback	19	4	Please draw only a single starting material.

evalFeedback	19	8	The starting alkene should have its C=C bond between the C atoms that bear the Cl atoms in the product.
qStmt	20		What five-carbon alkene will give the same, single product whether it reacts with HBr in the presence or the absence of a peroxide?
evalFeedback	20	1	Good!  The compound must be perfectly symmetrical across the double bond, and only cyclopentene fits the bill among five-carbon compounds.
evalFeedback	20	2	Please draw a five-carbon alkene.
evalFeedback	20	3	This compound will react either way to give the same mixture of products, but not a single product.
evalFeedback	20	4	This compound will give different products upon Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov reaction with HBr.

evalFeedback	2	5	What does the term 'ene' suggest about the functional groups present in this compound?

evalFeedback	3	3	How many carbons are in a vinyl group?
evalFeedback	3	4	What functional group does a vinyl group have?
evalFeedback	3	5	Vinyl <i>bromide</i>?
evalFeedback	3	6	Vinyl bromide is a single compound, not a salt.
qStmt	4		diallylamine
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!
evalFeedback	4	2	What does the prefix 'di' tell you about the number of allyl groups in the compound?
evalFeedback	4	3	The "di" refers to allyl, not amine.  There is only one N atom in this compound.
evalFeedback	4	4	The "di" means that there are two allyl groups in this compound, both attached to the N atom.
evalFeedback	4	5	An allyl group has three C atoms and a double bond.
evalFeedback	4	6	What functional group does an allyl group have in it?
evalFeedback	4	7	The term "amine" means a N atom with at least one C attached.

evalFeedback	5	9	Make sure your Cl atom is in the right position.
Topic: Alkenes; Set: Oxidations of alkenes
qStmt	1		Draw the major product of the reaction shown.  (CH3CO3H is peracetic acid, a peracid.)
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  An epoxide is formed, and the two new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene.
evalFeedback	1	2	The two new C-O bonds should form on the same face of the alkene.
evalFeedback	1	3	Yes, the answer is an epoxide, but please specify the stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	1	4	A peracid has three O atoms in it.  It would rather have two.  It transfers the extra O to the substrate.
evalFeedback	1	5	Only one O atom is transferred from the peracid to the alkene.
evalFeedback	1	6	The reaction consumes the alkene functional group.  The product should not be an alkene.
evalFeedback	1	7	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	1	8	When the peracid delivers O to the alkene, both C atoms of the alkene make new bonds to the O atom.
qStmt	2		Draw the product of the reaction shown.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The C=C bond is cleaved, and the two C atoms of the alkene each gain a double bond to an O atom.
evalFeedback	2	2	The C=C bond is cleaved in an ozonolysis reaction.
evalFeedback	2	3	The C=C bond is cleaved, but no other C-C bonds are made or broken.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	2	4	Look at the reagent in this reaction.  What atoms do you think should be incorporated into the product?
evalFeedback	2	5	After a Me2S workup, the product of an ozonolysis is always two carbonyl compounds or one dicarbonyl compound.
evalFeedback	2	6	Both C atoms formerly of the alkene gain new bonds to O.
evalFeedback	2	7	Although O3 contains three O atoms, only two of them are incorporated into the product.  The third O atom is consumed by Me2S to give DMSO as a by-product.
evalFeedback	2	8	The substrate neither gains nor loses H atoms in this reaction.
qStmt	3		Draw the product of the reaction shown.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  Syn-dihydroxylation of the alkene occurs.  The double bonds in the benzene ring remain untouched.
evalFeedback	3	2	The two new C-O bonds are made simultaneously in an OsO4-mediated dihydroxylation.  What does that suggest about the stereochemistry of addition?
evalFeedback	3	3	Please specify the stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	3	4	Os is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	5	The elements of NaHSO3 are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	The OsO4 delivers two O atoms to the substrate.
evalFeedback	3	7	The benzene ring (the ring with three alternating double bonds) is unaffected by OsO4.
evalFeedback	3	8	No C-C bonds are made or broken in the reaction of an alkene with OsO4.
evalFeedback	3	9	The C-H bonds in the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	3	10	The name of this reaction is "dihydroxylation."  What does that tell you about the number and nature of the functional group that is present in the product?
qStmt	4		Draw the product of the reaction shown.  (mCPBA is a peracid.)
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  Syn epoxidation followed by substitution at one of the C atoms with inversion results in overall anti dihydroxylation.
evalFeedback	4	2	Close.  If epoxidation is syn, and the second OH must do backside attack on one of the C atoms of the epoxide, what should be the stereochemistry of the product?
evalFeedback	4	3	Please specify the stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	4	4	An epoxide is obtained after step 1.  What does step 2 do to the epoxide?
evalFeedback	4	5	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	4	6	The peracid supplies one O atom to the substrate, and the NaOH supplies another one, so how many O atoms are present in the product?
evalFeedback	4	7	The benzene ring (the ring with three alternating double bonds) is unaffected by this set of reagents.
evalFeedback	4	8	No C-C sigma bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	4	9	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	4	10	The name of the overall reaction is "dihydroxylation."  What does that tell you about the number and nature of the functional group that is present in the product?
qStmt	5		Draw the product of the following reaction.  (mCPBA is a peracid.)
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  After epoxidation, the ^-CN attacks the less substituted C of the epoxide to give a hydroxynitrile.
evalFeedback	5	2	Close.  Which C of the intermediate epoxide should the ^-CN attack: the less substituted or the more substituted one?  (Hint: the second step is an SN2 substitution reaction.)
evalFeedback	5	3	The epoxide is the product after step 1.  What happens in step 2?
evalFeedback	5	4	Na is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	5	The purpose of the peracid is to deliver O to the substrate.  That O atom is retained in the product after the second step.
evalFeedback	5	6	The reagent in step 2 is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	7	Count the number of C atoms in the substrate and NaCN, and count the number of carbons in your product.
evalFeedback	5	8	Peracids react with alkenes to give products that are not alkenes.
evalFeedback	5	9	None of the C-C or C-H bonds in the starting material are absent in the product.
qStmt	6		Draw the alkene that, upon reaction with OsO4 and then aq. NaHSO3, would give the product shown.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Syn dihydroxylation of a cis alkene will give the observed product.
evalFeedback	6	2	OsO4 delivers the two OH groups to the same face of the alkene, so dihydroxylation of this alkene with OsO4 would give the diastereomer of the compound in the figure.
evalFeedback	6	3	OsO4 adds two OH groups to an alkene, so the starting alkene for this reaction should have no O atoms.
evalFeedback	6	4	None of the C-C or C-H bonds in an alkene are altered upon dihydroxylation, so your answer should have all the same C-C and C-H bonds as the diol.
evalFeedback	6	5	Your answer should have an alkene in place of the 1,2-diol unit.
qStmt	7		Draw the alkene that, upon reaction with a peracid and then NaOH, would give the 1,2-diol shown.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  This reaction sequence results in overall anti dihydroxylation, so the starting alkene must be cis to give the required diastereomer.
evalFeedback	7	2	The reaction sequence delivers the two OH groups to opposite faces of the alkene, so dihydroxylation of this alkene by this sequence would give the diastereomer of the compound in the figure.
evalFeedback	7	3	The reaction sequence results in 1,2-dihydroxylation, so the starting material would not have any O atoms in it.
evalFeedback	7	4	None of the C-C or C-H bonds of the starting material are altered in a dihydroxylation reaction.
evalFeedback	7	5	Your answer should have an alkene unit in place of the 1,2-diol unit.
qStmt	8		Draw an alkene that could be used to make the alkynyl alcohol shown.  Hint: A C-C bond-forming reaction is one of the steps that will convert the alkene into the compound shown.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  The alkynyl alcohol can be made from opening an epoxide with NaCCH, and the epoxide can be made from this alkene.
evalFeedback	8	2	Please draw an alkene.
evalFeedback	8	3	The starting alkene will not contain O.  O is introduced into the alkene by an epoxidation reaction, which is then used as an electrophile to form the C-C bond.
evalFeedback	8	4	The cyclohexyl group is present as such in the starting alkene.
evalFeedback	8	5	The product is made by a C-C-bond-forming reaction.  Which C-C bond in an alkyne is best disconnected?  How many C atoms should the starting material have?
evalFeedback	8	6	When disconnecting an alkyne, it is often a good idea to put a halogen atom on the C atom that is supposed to be electrophilic.  When that C atom is next to another C atom that bears an OH group, though, an epoxide makes a better electrophile.  The O atom of the OH group retrosynthetically becomes the O of the epoxide.
qStmt	9		What alkene could be used to make this dialdehyde?
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  Each C atom with a double bond to O in the target must have a double bond to a C in the starting material.  One good answer is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentene.  Another is 4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadiene.
evalFeedback	9	2	You are supposed to draw an alkene.
evalFeedback	9	3	The starting material would not contain O.  All the O in the product comes from O3.
evalFeedback	9	4	The saturated part of the dialdehyde framework should be present in the starting material.

evalFeedback	3	7	CH3O^- acts as a base toward this tertiary alkyl halide, not as a nucleophile.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.

qStmt	12		Under acidic conditions, OH can act as a leaving group.
evalFeedback	12	1	Right!  The major product is the more substituted alkene.
evalFeedback	12	2	Yes, the 2-methylcyclohexyl cation could undergo rearrangement to a 1-ethylcyclopentyl cation by a 1,2-alkyl shift of a ring bond followed by a 1,2-hydride shift.  Loss of H^+ would then give the product you have shown.  But if a shift were to occur, most likely it would be a 1,2-hydride shift to give the 1-methylcyclohexyl cation.

evalFeedback	12	4	The expected product is neutral.

evalFeedback	13	10	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  Although it's not the most substituted alkene that can be formed, this is the correct answer due to the fact that NaOC(CH3)3 is a very hindered base.
evalFeedback	14	2	Although Zaitsev's rule tells you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you the alkene with the most substituents (the one that you drew), this is not the correct answer. Keep in mind that NaOC(CH3)3 is a very hindered base.

evalFeedback	14	10	An elimination reaction always gives a product with one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	14	11	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material and an adjacent C.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  The elements of Br2 are lost, a new #pi bond is obtained, and the product consists of a mixture of stereoisomers.
evalFeedback	15	2	You are partially correct. The stereochemistry in the starting material is not specified, so most probably you will have a Z/E mixture as product.  To indicate a mixture, make one of the bonds from C(sp2) to C(sp3) into a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down).
evalFeedback	15	3	No, only one double bond will be formed. Zn is a reducing agent, and it will form ZnBr2.

qStmt	16		Under acidic conditions, OH can act as a leaving group.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  A 1,2-alkyl shift occurs during departure of the OH group, giving a 3&deg; carbocation, and loss of H^+ gives this product.
evalFeedback	16	2	This compound is only a minor product. Zaitsev's rule says which alkene regioisomer should be obtained predominantly?
evalFeedback	16	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	16	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	16	5	Under acidic conditions, OH is protonated and becomes a good leaving group.
evalFeedback	16	6	The product of an elimination reaction has the formula of the starting material minus the elements of H and the leaving group.

evalFeedback	16	9	In an elimination reaction, the product has one more #pi bond than the starting material.

evalFeedback	20	10	An elimination reaction always gives a product with one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	20	11	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material and an adjacent C.
evalFeedback	21	1	Right!  E^2 elimination requires that the leaving group and the adjacent H be antiperiplanar (180&deg; dihedral angle).  Because elimination in the Zaitsev direction cannot obey this stricture, the less substituted product is obtained.
evalFeedback	21	2	The configuration at the CH3 group remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	21	3	Zaitsev would agree with you, but you would both be wrong.  Elimination under basic conditions requires that the leaving group and the adjacent H be antiperiplanar.  In a ring, they must be trans.  Because the leaving group and the H on the more substituted adjacent C are not trans, elimination can't occur in that direction.
evalFeedback	21	4	The expected product is neutral.

qStmt	24		Remember to consider the geometric constraints of the E^2 reaction.
evalFeedback	24	1	Correct! There will be no reaction! The two Br atoms cannot achieve the antiperiplanar alignment required for an E^2 reaction.
evalFeedback	24	2	Because the Br atoms are cis, they cannot achieve the antiperiplanar alignment required for E^2 elimination.
evalFeedback	24	3	The answer is neutral.
evalFeedback	24	4	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	24	5	The answer does not contain I.

evalFeedback	25	8	The new #pi bond in the product should involve the C atoms that were bound to the Br atoms in the starting material.
qStmt	26		Remember to consider the geometric constraints of the E^2 reaction.
evalFeedback	26	1	Correct! There will be no reaction! The two Br atoms are trans, but they are locked into a diequatorial conformation because of the <i>trans</i>-decalin system (60&deg; dihedral angle), so E^2 elimination cannot occur.
evalFeedback	26	2	Even though the Br atoms are trans, they are locked in a diequatorial conformation, so they cannot achieve the antiperiplanar alignment required for E^2 elimination.

evalFeedback	26	5	The answer does not contain I.

header			What is the major product of the following reaction?

evalFeedback	1	2	Assume a polar reaction and a lack of radical initiators, and remember Markovnikov's rule!
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	2	11	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  The H and Br atoms end up attached only to the C atoms that are part of the C=C bond in the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	1	Yes!  The initial secondary carbocation undergoes a 1,2-hydride shift (rearrangement) to give a tertiary carbocation.
evalFeedback	3	2	Good answer, but not quite right.  The intermediate carbocation that would lead to this product undergoes a rearrangement to a more stable carbocation, so the product has the Br atom in a different position.
evalFeedback	3	3	No radical initiators are present, so assume the reaction proceeds by a polar mechanism, and remember Markovnikov's rule.

evalFeedback	3	5	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	3	11	No C-C bonds are made or broken when the starting material undergoes this reaction.

evalFeedback	4	1	Yes!  The initial secondary carbocation undergoes a 1,2-alkyl shift (rearrangement) to give a lower energy tertiary carbocation.
evalFeedback	4	2	Good answer, but there's a better one.  The intermediate carbocation that would lead to this product undergoes a rearrangement to a more stable carbocation before combining with Br^-.
evalFeedback	4	3	No radical initiators are present, so assume the reaction proceeds by a polar mechanism, and remember Markovnikov's rule.

evalFeedback	9	1	Correct! The product of the alkoxymercuration followed by reduction is an ether. Methanol adds to the alkene with Markovnikov regioselectivity.

evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) acts as a reducing agent delivering hydride ions to reduce the C-Hg bond. Neither Na nor B atoms are incorporated into the final product.

evalFeedback	5	5	Yes, this reaction results in addition of Cl and HO across the double bond, but with Markovnikov regiochemistry (the nucleophile adds to the C better able to bear a positive charge).
evalFeedback	5	6	In a different solvent this answer would be correct, but H2O is a nucleophile that participates in the reaction.
evalFeedback	5	7	The final product is neutral.
evalFeedback	5	8	Please draw only one molecule as your product.
evalFeedback	5	9	What is the role of the Cl2 in this reaction?
evalFeedback	5	10	Only one of the Cl atoms is incorporated into the product, acting as an electrophile.  The other Cl atom does not act as a nucleophile, because an excess of another nucleophile is present.
evalFeedback	5	11	H2O, a nucleophilic solvent, participates in this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	12	Only one equivalent of H2O participates in the reaction.
evalFeedback	5	13	Count your carbons.

evalFeedback	5	15	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	5	16	When H2O participates in this reaction, it replaces one of its O-H bonds with an O-C bond, but the other O-H bond remains.
evalFeedback	6	1	That's right!  Under acidic conditions, H2O can add across an alkene in Markovnikov fashion.
evalFeedback	6	2	Remember Markovnikov's rule? H2O is the nucleophile in this reaction, so to which C does the OH attach?
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	4	Alkenes are nucleophiles. What is the electrophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	6	5	Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	6	6	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	7	An alkene reacts under these conditions to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	6	8	Look at the reagent above the arrow.  What functional group is likely to be present in the product?
evalFeedback	6	9	To which C atom is the OH group likely to be attached?
evalFeedback	7	1	That's right!  Br2 adds across a C=C #pi bond with anti stereochemistry.

evalFeedback	7	3	Halogenation of an alkene is stereospecific.  Is it syn or anti?
evalFeedback	7	4	Does addition of Br2 proceed with syn, anti, or no stereospecificity?
evalFeedback	7	5	In the presence of strong light these products may be obtained, but no light is indicated, so assume this reaction is carried out in the dark. How does the alkene behave toward the electrophilic Br2?
evalFeedback	7	6	Please draw a single molecule as your response.
evalFeedback	7	7	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	8	One Br atom in Br2 acts as an electrophile; the other acts as a nucleophile.

evalFeedback	8	1	That's right!  Anti-Markovnikov and syn addition of H2O across the double bond occurs.
evalFeedback	8	2	Hydroboration does not proceed with anti addition of H and OH across the #pi bond.
evalFeedback	8	3	Hydroboration-oxidation is stereospecific.  Is it syn or anti?
evalFeedback	8	4	The regiochemistry is right, but this compound has two stereocenters.  Please indicate their relative configuration.
evalFeedback	8	5	Yes, the product is an alcohol, but not this one. In the addition of borane to the alkene, does B or H act as the electrophile? In the second step, the boron is replaced by OH.
evalFeedback	8	6	No, a diol is produced by addition of OsO4, not by this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	7	The B in the intermediate is replaced with another group in the final product. (That is the purpose of adding H2O2 and HO^-.)
evalFeedback	8	8	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	9	Which C atoms of the starting material are most reactive? The OH should be attached to one of them.
evalFeedback	8	10	The product is not an ether.  THF is simply a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	11	You have drawn a hydroperoxide (has an OOH group). This reaction does not produce hydroperoxides. What functional group looks like a hydroperoxide but is much more common?
evalFeedback	8	12	Look at the second set of conditions.  What functional group is likely to be present in the product?
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  Peroxides do not affect HCl addition.  It is also possible that no reaction will occur.
evalFeedback	9	2	Right!  Peroxides do not catalyze the addition of HCl to alkenes.  You could also draw the product of electrophilic (Markovnikov) addition of HCl to the alkene.
evalFeedback	9	3	Peroxides do not effect HCl addition.
evalFeedback	9	4	More than one Cl atom is incorporated into the product when alkenes react with Cl2, but not with HCl.
evalFeedback	9	5	The reagent is HCl, so the product should incorporate a Cl atom.
evalFeedback	9	6	The Cl atom in the product should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene in the starting material.
evalFeedback	9	7	The peroxide is merely a catalyst of this reaction, so O is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	8	Count your carbons, please.
evalFeedback	9	9	Alkenes react with HCl to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	9	10	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
qStmt	10		D is deuterium, ^2H.
evalFeedback	10	1	That's right!  Syn addition of D and OH across the C=C bond occurs.  Because the second step involves D2O2 and DO^-, all of the OH groups exchange H for D.
evalFeedback	10	2	Syn addition of D and OH across the C=C bond occurs.  Because the second step involves D2O2 and DO^-, all of the OH groups exchange H for D.  You've drawn the product after workup, which would exchange the D atoms back to H.

evalFeedback	10	4	This reaction is stereospecific.  Please indicate the relative configuration of the two stereocenters.
evalFeedback	10	5	The product does indeed contain D on C^3, but not or not only in the other positions you indicate. The OH groups exchange their H atoms for D in step 2, but the H atoms attached to C in the starting material are not exchanged.
evalFeedback	10	6	No, a diol is produced by addition of OsO4, not by this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	7	Step 1 involves BD3, not BH3.  Where should the D atom be incorporated?
evalFeedback	10	8	Because step 1 involves BD3, not BH3, the new C-H bond is actually a C-D bond.  [To bring up a D atom, just type the letter D.]  Because step 2 involves D2O2 and DO^-, all of the OH groups exchange their H atoms for D.
evalFeedback	10	9	The product does indeed contain D, but not in the positions you indicate.  The OH groups exchange their H atoms for D in step 2, but the H atoms attached to C in the starting material are not exchanged.
evalFeedback	10	10	Please draw a single, neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	11	The B in the intermediate is replaced with another group in the final product. (That is the purpose of adding H2O2 and HO^-.)
evalFeedback	10	12	The reaction results in the addition of D-OD across the C=C bond.
evalFeedback	10	13	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	14	The C=C bond is consumed under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	10	15	The product is not an ether.  THF is simply a solvent in this reaction.

evalFeedback	17	2	What reaction can the secondary carbocation formed by protonation of the #pi bond undergo before the C-Br bond forms?

evalFeedback	25	16	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable. After the O of the epoxide reacts with H^+ to make a better leaving group, the bottom C&#8211;O bond cleaves to give a carbocation, which reacts with the nearby alkene to give a new carbocation. Fragmentation of a C&#8211;H bond adjacent to the carbocation then gives the target alkene. It is also reasonable to telescope the C&#8211;O bond-breaking and C&#8211;C bond-making steps into a single step, but the first (protonation and last (deprotonation) steps shouldn't be telescoped.

evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Anti-Markovnikov addition of H2O across the triple bond is followed by tautomerization of the enol to the carbonyl compound.

evalFeedback	6	6	The C(sp) atom is much more acidic than the C(sp3) atom.
evalFeedback	6	7	The C#tripleC bond remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	6	8	That's the starting material.  What is the role of NaNH2?

evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	4	The Cl in 1-chloropentane is a leaving group.

evalFeedback	9	8	No C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	9	Make sure that the nucleophilic atom makes a bond to the electrophilic one.  No other C-C bonds should change.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  The C-Na bond dissociates to give a carbanion, which promotes an E2  elimination on the alkyl halide to give back an alkene and the original alkyne.
evalFeedback	10	2	Correct! But what happens to the other reagent? Draw that other product as well.
evalFeedback	10	3	You cannot have an SN2 reaction on a tertiary alkyl halide! What other reaction can happen? If 1-butynyl anion can't react as a nucleophile, what else can it react as?
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw one or more uncharged products.
evalFeedback	10	5	The Br in <i>t</i>-butyl bromide is a leaving group.

evalFeedback	10	7	The alkyne functional group is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	10	8	Sodium propynylide is not only a good nucleophile that can do a substitution reaction when added to an alkyl halide.  What reaction always competes with substitution?  What would be the role of sodium propynylide in that reaction?

evalFeedback	13	10	Make sure that the nucleophilic atom makes a bond to the electrophilic one.  No other C-C bonds should change.
evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  An alcohol is a much stronger acid than an alkyne, and alcohols are not electrophiles under basic conditions, so all that happens here is an acid-base reaction.
evalFeedback	14	2	Correct! But what happens with the other reagent? Draw that structure as well.
evalFeedback	14	3	OH is a poor leaving group, so alcohols are not usually electrophiles under basic conditions. What other reaction can happen? If 1-butyne anion can't react as a nucleophile, what else can it react as?

evalFeedback	16	11	Which atoms of the starting material are most reactive?  The O atom will end up attached to one of them.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!  H2O adds across one of the #pi bonds, and the enol tautomerizes to the ketone.  There is no strong preference to add to either side of the alkyne, so two products are obtained.
evalFeedback	17	2	You're on the right path. But keep in mind that the alkyne is unsymmetrical. Will there be a preference for addition to just one side of the alkyne?
evalFeedback	17	3	Under acidic conditions, enols tautomerize to what other functional group?
evalFeedback	17	4	Yes, 2-hexanone is one of the products, but the other compound you have drawn is not.  Why would H2O add just to C^2 of the alkyne?

evalFeedback	18	2	The enol is the initial product of Markovnikov addition of H2O across a #pi bond, but the enol tautomerizes to a more stable carbonyl compound.
evalFeedback	18	3	What would Markovnikov say about your answer?
evalFeedback	18	4	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	18	5	Because this compound is a terminal alkyne, the two sides of the alkyne are differentiated, and only one product will be obtained.

evalFeedback	19	5	H2SO4 and HgSO4 are catalysts for the reaction, and hence are not incorporated into the product; the real reagent is the "aqueous" part of aqueous H2SO4!
evalFeedback	19	6	The number of C atoms in the product should equal the number of C atoms in the starting material.
evalFeedback	19	7	The elements of H2O are incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	19	8	Only one equivalent of H2O is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	19	9	One #pi bond of the alkyne is consumed in this reaction, but the product retains a #pi bond.
evalFeedback	19	10	No C-C bonds are formed or broken under these conditions. As you can see, there is a ring in the molecule, which should be present in the product as well.
evalFeedback	19	11	Which C atom will react with the H2O?
evalFeedback	20	1	Right!  Two ketones are obtained because the alkyne is unsymmetrical, but it doesn't have a strong preference for adding to one side or the other.
evalFeedback	20	2	You're on the right path. But keep in mind that the alkyne is unsymmetrical. You should have an answer with two carbonyl products.
evalFeedback	20	3	Please draw only uncharged products.

evalFeedback	12	5	The acid bromide is converted into what functional group when NH3 is around?
evalFeedback	12	6	Both Br groups will act as leaving groups, so no Br atoms will be incorporated into the final product.

Topic: Amino acids, peptides, and proteins; Set: Analysis of peptides
qStmt	1		<i>Aspartame</i> (Nutrasweet) is a remarkably sweet-tasting dipeptide ester. Complete hydrolysis of aspartame gives phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol. Mild incubation with carboxypeptidase has no effect on aspartame. Treatment of aspartame with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by mild hydrolysis gives the phenylthiohydantoin of aspartic acid. Propose a structure for aspartame.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right! The phenyl isothiocyanate reaction indicates that the peptide is aspartylphenylalanine, not phenylalanylaspartic acid.  Aspartame must be a methyl ester because methanol is formed after hydrolysis. The terminal COOH group must be the one that is esterified because there is no reaction with carboxypeptidase.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please indicate the configuration of all stereocenters.
evalFeedback	1	3	The fact that carboxypeptidase fails to act on this dipeptide indicates which CO2H group is converted into a methyl ester?

evalFeedback	1	12	The fact that treatment of Aspartame with phenyl isothiocyanate gives the phenylthiohydantoin of aspartic acid, not the phenylthiohydantoin of methyl aspartate, indicates what about the side chain of the aspartic acid group?
qStmt	2		A molecular weight determination has shown that an unknown peptide is a pentapeptide, and an amino acid analysis shows that it contains one Gly, two Ala, one Met, and one Phe residue. Treatment of the original pentapeptide with carboxypeptidase gives alanine as the first free amino acid released. Sequential treatment of the pentapeptide with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by mild hydrolysis gives the derivatives shown below. Propose a structure for the unknown pentapeptide.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right! The carboxypeptidase test indicates that the C-terminal amino acid is alanine. The three phenyl isothiocyanate tests indicate that the three N-terminal amino acids are Phe, Ala, and Gly, in this order.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please indicate the correct configuration at all stereocenters.
evalFeedback	2	3	What is the structure of alanine?

evalFeedback	2	8	What functional group connects the amino acids of a peptide?
evalFeedback	2	9	The pentapeptide is a series of five amino acids.  The fact that alanine is released when the peptide is treated with carboxypeptidase indicates what about its position in the peptide?
evalFeedback	2	10	Treatment of the pentapeptide once with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by mild hydrolysis gives the phenylthiohydantoin of phenylalanine.  What does this information indicate about the nature of the first amino acid in the peptide?
evalFeedback	2	11	Treatment of the pentapeptide twice with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by mild hydrolysis gives the phenylthiohydantoin of alanine.  What does this information indicate about the nature of the second amino acid in the peptide?
evalFeedback	2	12	Treatment of the pentapeptide three times with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by mild hydrolysis gives the phenylthiohydantoin of glycine.  What does this information indicate about the nature of the third amino acid in the peptide?
evalFeedback	2	13	The pentapeptide is constructed from the five amino acids indicated in the question minus four equivalents of H2O as they are condensed together.  Although the basic structures of the four different amino acids in the pentapeptide are all present and correctly drawn in the compound you have drawn, its formula is not consistent with what the formula of the pentapeptide should be (C22H33N5O6S).
evalFeedback	2	14	Pay attention to the order of the five amino acids.
qStmt	3		Metabolism of arginine produces urea and the rare amino acid <i>ornithine</i>. Ornithine has an isoelectric point close to 10. Propose a structure for ornithine.
evalFeedback	3	1	Correct! The high isoelectric point suggests a strongly basic side chain as in lysine. The N-CH2 bond in the side chain of arginine is likely to remain intact during the metabolism.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please indicate the correct configuration at the stereocenter.
evalFeedback	3	3	This is arginine, not ornithine.
evalFeedback	3	4	Ornithine is an #a-amino acid.  What substructure must it contain?
evalFeedback	3	5	All of the C-C bonds in arginine are preserved in ornithine.
evalFeedback	3	6	Which atom in arginine is most susceptible to attack by H2O?  Cleavage of what bond will then give a compound that can tautomerize to urea?
qStmt	4		Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide that serves as a mild reducing agent to detoxify peroxides and mantain the cysteine residues of hemoglobin and other red blood cell proteins in the reduced state. Complete hydrolysis of glutathione gives Gly, Glu, and Cys. Treatment of glutathione with carboxypeptidase gives glycine as the first free amino acid released. Treatment of glutathione with phenyl isothiocyanate gives the phenylthiohydantoin of glutamic acid. Propose a structure for glutathione that is consistent with this information.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  The phenyl isothiocyanate test indicates that the N-terminal amino acid is Glu, and the carboxypeptidase test indicates that the C-terminal amino acid is Gly.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please indicate the correct configuration of all stereocenters.
evalFeedback	4	3	What is the structure of cysteine (Cys)?
evalFeedback	4	4	What is the structure of glutamic acid (Glu)?

Topic: Benzene and its derivatives; Set: Electrophilic aromatic substitution
qStmt	1		Give the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  The NO2 group replaces a H on the ring.  The CO2H group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it is a meta director.
evalFeedback	1	2	Is the -COOH group an ortho-para or a meta director?
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	5	Under these conditions, sulfuric acid acts merely as a catalyst.  No S is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	6	In this reaction, HNO3 and C6H5CO2H combine and lose the elements of H2O.  What should be the formula of your product?
evalFeedback	1	7	The aromatic ring with its three #pi bonds is preserved.
evalFeedback	1	8	The CO2H group remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	1	9	In this reaction, one of the H atoms on the ring is replaced by a different group.
evalFeedback	1	10	The product contains a new C-N bond, not a new C-O bond.
evalFeedback	1	11	What functional group is introduced when an aromatic ring is treated with HNO3?
qStmt	2		Give the major product of the following reaction:
isopropylbenzene + cyclohexene + catalytic HF
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The cyclohexene is protonated by the HF to give a carbocation, which reacts at the para position of isopropylbenzene in a Friedel-Crafts reaction to give the product you drew.
evalFeedback	2	2	Is the isopropyl group an ortho-para or a meta director?
evalFeedback	2	3	Although the isopropyl group is an ortho-para director, in practice the ortho product is only a small component of the product mixture because of steric encumbrance.
evalFeedback	2	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	2	6	HF is merely an acidic catalyst.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	7	The product retains the three #pi bonds of isopropylbenzene.
evalFeedback	2	8	This Friedel-Crafts reaction is a substitution with respect to the aromatic ring, but is an addition with respect to the alkene. When a reagent adds to an alkene, does the product retain its double bond?
evalFeedback	2	9	The formula of the product should equal the combined formula of the two starting materials.  (HF is merely a catalyst.)
evalFeedback	2	10	What is the structure of <B>iso</B>propylbenzene?
qStmt	3		Give the major product of the following reaction: naphthalene + acetyl chloride + AlCl3
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  Naphthalene prefers to undergo electrophilic substitution at C(1) rather than C(2).  In either case, the intermediate carbocation has the same number of resonance structures, but the intermediate carbocation derived from substitution at C(1) has more resonance structures that retain the three alternating double bonds in the ring not undergoing substitution.
evalFeedback	3	2	Close, but not quite right. Which position of the naphthalene is more likely to be attacked?
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	5	AlCl3 is a Lewis acid. It converts acetyl chloride into a better electrophile by removing the chloride.  Al is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	Aromatic compounds are nucleophiles. There is no electrophilic Cl in this reaction, so the product cannot contain Cl.
evalFeedback	3	7	What is the structure of acetyl chloride?  The acetyl group is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	8	The compound you drew does not retain the naphthalene group. Aromatic compounds like naphthalene react with electrophiles to give products with the same number of rings and double bonds.
evalFeedback	3	9	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials (AlCl3 is a catalyst), minus the elements of HCl.
qStmt	4		Give the major product of the following reaction: <i>o</i>-methylaniline + benzenediazonium chloride  [(PhN&equiv;N)^+ Cl^-]
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  The <i>o</i>-methylaniline undergoes a substitution reaction at the para position.  The new substituent is the N=N-Ph group.  In general, diazonium ions react with electron-rich aromatic compounds to give azo compounds.
evalFeedback	4	2	The NH2 group is much more powerful ortho-para director than the Me group.
evalFeedback	4	3	Although the NH2 group is an ortho-para director, in practice the ortho product is only a small component of the product mixture because of steric encumbrance.
evalFeedback	4	4	The aromatic ring of an aniline, not the N of the aniline, reacts with the terminal N of diazonium ions.
evalFeedback	4	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	6	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	4	7	Although most nucleophiles react with arenediazonium ions at C to displace gaseous N2, phenols and anilines react directly at the terminal N of the N2^+ group to give azo compounds (Ar-N=N-Ar').
evalFeedback	4	8	The C-C and C-N #sigma bonds and the three #pi bonds of <i>o</i>-methylaniline remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	4	9	The CH3 group in <i>o</i>-methylaniline remains intact.
evalFeedback	4	10	All of the #sigma bonds and the three ring #pi bonds of PhN2^+ remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	4	11	When an electron-rich aromatic compound is combined with a diazonium ion, what unusual functional group does the product contain?
evalFeedback	4	12	The product should have the formula equal to the sum of the formulae of the starting materials minus the elements of HCl.
qStmt	5		Give the major product of the following reaction: phenyl cyclohexyl ether + Br2, FeBr3
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Substitution of Br for H occurs at the para position of the aromatic ring.
evalFeedback	5	2	Although the alkoxy group is an ortho-para director, in practice the ortho product is only a small component of the product mixture because of steric encumbrance.
evalFeedback	5	3	Is the alkoxy group an ortho-para or meta director?
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	5	6	FeBr3 is a Lewis acid. It converts Br2 into a better electrophile by pulling Br^- away from Br^+.  Fe is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	7	None of the C-C bonds of the starting material are affected by the reaction.  Make sure you know the structure of phenyl cyclohexyl ether.
evalFeedback	5	8	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formula of the two starting materials (FeBr3 is merely a catalyst), minus the elements of HBr.
evalFeedback	5	9	The cyclohexyl group is unaffected by the reaction.  A reaction takes place on the phenyl ring.
qStmt	6		Give the major product of the following reaction:
phenol + concentrated H2SO4 + #heat.  (There is more than one correct answer, but draw just one.)
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Concentrated H2SO4 puts an SO3H group on an aromatic compound, and the OH group is an ortho-para director.  Large amounts of ortho <i>and</i> para products are produced when phenol is the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	6	2	Good!  Slightly more para product is produced, but, when phenol is the nucleophile, so much ortho product is produced that it has to be called a major product, also.
evalFeedback	6	3	Is the OH group an ortho-para or a meta director?

evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The Et group is an ortho-para director, so the major product is para.

evalFeedback	7	8	In the absence of FeBr3, and in the presence of light, ethylbenzene would react with Br2 at the benzylic CH2 group.  But that is not the situation here, so the ethyl group is unaffected by the reaction conditions.
qStmt	8		Before spectroscopy was invented, <i>Korner's absolute method</i> was used to determine whether a disubstituted benzene derivative was the ortho, meta, or para isomer. Korner's method involves adding a third group (often a nitro group) and determining how many isomers are formed.

evalFeedback	10	4	No C-C bonds are formed or broken in this reaction, and the product must have the formula C8H6.
evalFeedback	10	5	Two C atoms are particularly acidic because their deprotonation leads to aromatic rings.

evalFeedback	12	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	12	4	The benzene ring is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	12	5	HNO3 is an acidic oxidizing agent. Its elements should not be part of the product. It converts I2 to an iodonium ion, which is an electrophile.
evalFeedback	12	6	HNO3 is an acidic oxidizing agent. It converts I2 to an iodonium ion, which is an electrophile, hence it should be part of the product.

evalFeedback	14	8	In the absence of FeBr3, and in the presence of light, isopopylbenzene would react with Br2 at the benzylic CH group.  But that is not the situation here, so the isopropyl group is unaffected by the reaction conditions.
qStmt	15		Give the major product of the following reaction:
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  Fuming H2SO4 puts an SO3H group on the benzene ring.

qStmt	16		Electrophilic aromatic substitution usually occurs at the 1-position of naphthalene. Give the major product of the following reaction.

evalFeedback	17	2	When naphthalene reacts with Br^+ at the 2 position, a carbocation is obtained that can be stabilized by resonance with the isolated #pi bond in the same ring, but only if the other ring becomes nonaromatic.

header			Give the major product of the following reaction.  Draw the starting material if no reaction occurs.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  An -OR group attached to a ring is a strong ortho-para director.  These reaction conditions add the NO2 group to the ring.
evalFeedback	1	2	Your answer may be a minor product, but ortho-para directors usually give much greater amounts of the para product (less steric hindrance).
evalFeedback	1	3	The carbonyl group is a meta director only if it attached directly to the ring.  In this case, an O atom (with lone pairs) is directly attached to the ring.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	6	Although both nitric and sulfuric acid are present in the reaction mixture, nitric acid is much more reactive toward aromatic compounds.

evalFeedback	1	8	The acetoxy group remains unchanged.

evalFeedback	2	7	The material obtained after step 1 is a nucleophile. The O in D2O is not electrophilic, and Et2O is only a solvent.
evalFeedback	2	8	The intermediate obtained after step 1 contains a C-Mg bond, but the final product does not contain Mg, because the nucleophilic C atom (attached to Mg) attacks an electrophilic atom in the final step.
evalFeedback	2	9	The Br atom is not incorporated into the final organic product.  The Mg converts the C attached to Br into a nucleophile, and that C then reacts with an electrophile, ejecting the Br atom.
evalFeedback	2	10	None of the C-C or C-H bonds of the starting material are affected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	2	11	Et2O is merely a solvent for the reaction.  The Et group is not incorporated into the organic product.

evalFeedback	2	13	What happens to the reactivity of the compound in step 1?  What atom will be incorporated into the product in step 2?

evalFeedback	3	2	Although the CH3O group is an ortho-para director, in practice the ortho product is only a small component of the product mixture because of the steric encumbrance.
evalFeedback	3	3	Is the CH3O group an ortho-para or meta director?
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	AlCl3 is a catalyst of the reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	7	The formula of the product should equal the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.  (AlCl3 is a catalyst, not a starting material.)
evalFeedback	3	8	The product has only one ring.  When the anhydride undergoes a Friedel-Crafts reaction, the bond between the ring O and one of the carbonyl C atoms is cleaved.
evalFeedback	3	9	What functional group is introduced when an acyl anhydride (like an acyl halide) reacts with an aromatic compound?
evalFeedback	3	10	When cyclic anhydrides react with aromatic compounds in a Friedel-Crafts reaction, one carbonyl group becomes a ketone, and the other becomes a carboxylic acid.

evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  Bromination occurs at the position para to the N.

evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	5	5	FeCl3 is a Lewis acid catalyst of the reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	6	The CF3 group is essentially inert.
evalFeedback	5	7	The formula of the product should equal the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials (FeCl3 is a catalyst, so it is excluded) minus the elements of HCl.
qStmt	6		NBS = <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide, a brominating agent.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Step 1 does benzylic bromination.  Step 2 converts the bromide into a Grignard reagent.  Step 3 replaces the Mg bond with a C-C-O^- group.  Step 4 protonates the O to give the alcohol.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	6	4	The succinimide ring of NBS is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	5	Although intermediates in this sequence of reactions contain Mg or Br, the ultimate product contains neither.
evalFeedback	6	6	The number of C and O atoms in the product equals the sum of C and O atoms in toluene and in ethylene oxide.  Neither NBS nor Et2O contributes O or C atoms to the product.
evalFeedback	6	7	Believe it or not, the phenyl ring is completely unaffected by this reaction sequence.  All the chemistry occurs at the benzylic position.
evalFeedback	6	8	Ethylene oxide is a three-membered ring with an O atom at one of the corners.  The C-C bond of the ring stays intact when the compound reacts.
evalFeedback	6	9	When an epoxide like ethylene oxide reacts with a nucleophile, the product is an alcohol.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right! The two electron-withdrawing NO2 groups activate the benzene ring for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.
evalFeedback	7	2	You're on the right path. There is formed indeed a C-OCH3 bond but the reactive C is the one which has the Cl attached. Try again.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	7	6	Cl will be a leaving group in this reaction.

evalFeedback	7	8	The benzene ring is retained into the product.
evalFeedback	7	9	The product should have as many C atoms as the starting materials have. Sodium methoxide is the nucleophile in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	10	Identify the nucleophile and the electrophile and make the right bond. What functional group will be formed?
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  The Friedel-Crafts reaction occurs at the para position of isopropoxybenzene due to the electron-donating effect of the isopropoxy group and steric encumbrance at the ortho position.
evalFeedback	8	2	Although the isopropoxy group is an ortho-para director, in practice the ortho product is only a small component of the product mixture because of steric encumbrance.

evalFeedback	9	5	The product has only one ring.

evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a neutral molecule.
evalFeedback	10	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	10	6	AlCl3 is merely a catalyst in this reaction.  Its elements will not be incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	10	9	The benzene ring with its three double bonds is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  The MeO group is the most electron-donating group, so the incoming electrophile will be attached to the position ortho to it (the para position being blocked).

evalFeedback	11	3	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	12	5	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.

evalFeedback	13	10	What functional group is added to the benzene ring in the reaction with HNO3?
evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  The NCOPh group is an activating group, whereas the CONPh is a withdrawing group, so the incoming electrophile will be attached to the para position of the ring attached to N, ortho being sterically hindered.
evalFeedback	14	2	The ortho position is pretty hindered, so this will be a minor product. What other position is activated by the N atom?
evalFeedback	14	3	What position is activated by the N atom? Is it an ortho-para or meta director?

evalFeedback	16	8	The product has only one ring.
evalFeedback	16	9	The amide group is inert under the reaction conditions.  It is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	16	10	The NHAc and Me groups remain para to one another and are unaffected under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	16	11	What functional group is introduced when an acyl anhydride reacts with an aromatic compound?
evalFeedback	16	12	The OAc group from Ac2O will act as a leaving group. An electrophile is formed. The aromatic ring will be the nucleophile. Identify the electrophile and nucleophile, and make the right new C-C bond.
qStmt	17		In this reaction, two products are formed.  Draw them both.
evalFeedback	17	1	Right! The HO^- promotes elimination of HCl to give an extremely reactive "benzyne".  Then the HO^- will attack either of the two C atoms of the alkyne, and protonation of the other C gives either phenol.
evalFeedback	17	2	The correct answer contains two structures.
evalFeedback	17	3	Your answer is one of the correct products, but there's another one, too.  Hint: Both products derive from an intermediate that is obtained by elimination of HCl from the starting material.
evalFeedback	17	4	Your answer contains one of the correct products, but the other compound in your answer is incorrect.  Hint: Both products derive from an intermediate that is obtained by elimination of HCl from the starting material.
evalFeedback	17	5	Please draw only neutral products.
evalFeedback	17	6	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	17	7	Cl will act as a leaving group.  It is not present in the organic products.
evalFeedback	17	8	A triple bond is present in the intermediate, but this intermediate is exceedingly unstable and reacts with the excess HO^-.
evalFeedback	17	9	The product should have as many C atoms as the starting materials have.
evalFeedback	17	10	No C-C bonds are formed or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	17	11	The saturated portion of the starting material remains unchanged in this reaction.
evalFeedback	18	1	Right! A Birch reduction occurs to convert the benzene ring to a 1,4-cyclohexadiene.  The carbonyl group attached to the phenyl ring is an electron-withdrawing group, so the C atom bearing this group bears a H in the product.
evalFeedback	18	2	Right! If only two equivalents of Na are used, just the ketone is reduced to the alcohol.
evalFeedback	18	3	Right! If four equivalents of Na are used, the ketone is reduced to the alkane.
evalFeedback	18	4	Right! If at least six equivalents of Na are used, the ketone is reduced to the alkane and the beznene ring is reduced to the most substituted 1,4-cyclohexadiene.
evalFeedback	18	5	You're on the right path; this is a Birch reduction. But the carbon bearing the electron-withdrawing group should bear a H atom in the product.
evalFeedback	18	6	Na is an electron donor and NH3 helps to solvate the electron. Their elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	18	7	Ethanol acts only as a proton donor and cosolvent in this reaction.  Except for the H atom, its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	18	8	No C-C bonds are formed or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	18	9	In a Birch reduction, the benzene ring is reduced.
evalFeedback	18	10	The result of a Birch reduction is always a 1,4-cyclohexadiene.

qStmt	4		There are two correct answers to this question, but draw only one.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good! The MeO group is an activator and an ortho-para director. In this case, there is not much steric difference between the ortho and para products, so it is not clear which one will predominate.

evalFeedback	4	3	To which position does the MeO group direct substitution reactions?
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	4	6	FeBr3 is merely a catalyst.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	4	8	In a bromination of an aromatic ring, a C-H bond is replaced with a C-Br bond.  What should be the formula of the product?
evalFeedback	4	9	In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the only change is that a C-H bond of an aromatic ring is replaced with a C-Br bond.
evalFeedback	4	10	The more electron-rich aromatic ring undergoes the substitution reaction.  The ring with the electron-withdrawing group remains untouched.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Bromination occurs ortho to the electron-rich MeO group.
evalFeedback	5	2	You're on the right path! The structure you drew is a minor product. Br will attach ortho to the OMe group, but there are two ortho positions. The one you chose is more sterically hindered.

evalFeedback	1	5	AlCl3 is used as a catalyst in the reaction, hence it is not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	5	1	Good! The starting material is doubly electrophilic.  Both of the electrophilic centers in the starting material react with the same molecule of benzene to form a bicyclic product.  Only one equivalent of benzene is incorporated into the product because the second, intramolecular reaction is much faster than an intermolecular reaction.
evalFeedback	5	2	You're on the right track, but only one equivalent of benzene is incorporated into the product, despite the presence of excess benzene.

evalFeedback	7	2	Although under some circumstances you might expect this product, assume that such a deep-seated rearrangement does not occur.

qStmt	10		Give the product of the reaction of benzene with the following compounds.  More than one product can be obtained, but draw just one.
evalFeedback	10	1	Excellent!  The 2-chloroethyl cation reacts with benzene to give this product.  It can react further with another equivalent of benzene to give 1,2-diphenylethane.  The primary ClCH2CH2^+ cation does not quickly rearrange to ClCH(CH3)^+ because a lone pair of the Cl atom temporarily makes a bond to the carbocation to form a chloronium ion.
evalFeedback	10	2	Excellent!  The 2-chloroethyl cation reacts with benzene to give (2-chloroethyl)benzene, which reacts further with another equivalent of benzene to give 1,2-diphenylethane.  The primary cation derived from (2-chloroethyl)benzene does not quickly rearrange to a secondary benzylic cation because the phenyl ring stabilizes the cation by forming a cyclopropane ring with a #pi bond.
evalFeedback	10	3	Your answer is quite reasonable, but, perhaps surprisingly, the primary ClCH2CH2^+ cation does not quickly rearrange to a secondary cation because the Cl atom stabilizes the cation by forming a chloronium ion (three-membered ring with Cl^+), so substitution without rearrangement is observed.
evalFeedback	10	4	Your answer is quite reasonable, but, perhaps surprisingly, the primary PhCH2CH2^+ cation does not quickly rearrange to a secondary PhCH(CH3)^+ cation because the Ph ring temporarily uses a #pi bond to form a cyclopropane ring, so substitution without rearrangement is observed.

evalFeedback	16	1	Right!  Isobutylene is protonated at the terminal C to give a <i>t</i>-butyl cation, and this group replaces the H in the 1-position because the intermediate carbocation can enjoy resonance with the #pi bond in the same ring without destroying the resonance of the other ring.

qStmt	17		Electrophilic aromatic substitution usually occurs at the 1-position of naphthalene. Predict the major product of the following reaction:
evalFeedback	17	1	Good.  BF3 acts as a Lewis acid and converts the OH group into a better leaving group. The carbocation thus formed is attacked by naphthalene.  The cyclohexyl group replaces the H in the 1-position of naphthalene because the intermediate carbocation can enjoy resonance with the #pi bond in the same ring without destroying the resonance of the other ring.
evalFeedback	17	2	When naphthalene reacts at the 2 position, a carbocation is obtained that can be stabilized by resonance with the isolated #pi bond in the same ring, but only if the other ring becomes nonaromatic.  Can naphthalene react at another position to give an even better carbocation?
evalFeedback	17	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	17	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	17	5	BF3 is used as a catalyst in the reaction, hence its elements are not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	17	7	The product should not contain any atoms other than C and H.

Topic: Benzene and its derivatives; Set: MS, IR, NMR Spectroscopy
qStmt	1		Propose a structure consistent with the following NMR spectra and this additional information:  Elemental analysis shows the molecular formula to be C8H7ClO. The IR spectrum shows a moderate absorption at 1602 cm^^-1 and a strong absorption at 1690 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct! The five aromatic H atoms indicate a monosubstituted benzene, and a 2 H singlet at 4.7 ppm shows a deshielded methylene group. The IR suggests a carbonyl at 1690 cm^^-1 and an aromatic ring at 1602 cm^^-1 . Your structure matches all these characterististics.
evalFeedback	1	2	There are 3 absorbances in the aromatic region of the H NMR and four in the aromatic region of the C NMR. Also, there is an IR absorption peak at 1602 cm^^-1 . What functional group is responsible for these peaks?
evalFeedback	1	3	What functional group is responsible for the absorption at 1690 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	1	4	Your structure doesn't have the molecular formula C8H7OCl.
evalFeedback	1	5	The NMR shows a total of five aromatic protons. What does this tell you about the degree of substitution of benzene ring?
evalFeedback	1	6	The IR absorption peak for acyl chlorides is usually around 1800 cm^^-1 . Your compound absorbs around 1690 cm^^-1 , therefore it is not an acyl chloride.
qStmt	2		Propose a structure consistent with the following NMR spectra and this additional information:  The mass spectrum shows a double molecular ion of ratio 1:1 at <i>m/z</i> 184 and 186.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! The mass spectral evidence of molecular ion peaks of 1:1 intensity shows the presence of a Br atom. The m/z 184 minus 79 for bromine gives a mass of 105 for the rest of the molecule which is equal to C8H9. The ^1H NMR spectrum shows four aromatic H atoms in a typical para pattern. The 2 H quartet and 3 H triplet are characteristic of an ethyl group.
evalFeedback	2	2	There are two signals in the aromatic region of the ^1H NMR spectrum, and four in the aromatic region of the 13C NMR spectrum. What functional group is responsible for these peaks?
evalFeedback	2	3	The mass spectrum shows a double molecular ion of ratio 1:1. What atom must be present in the molecule?
evalFeedback	2	4	Your compound should not have an exact mass of 186 when it is calculated with the lighter isotope of Br.
evalFeedback	2	5	What should be the exact mass of your compound?
evalFeedback	2	6	In the ^1H NMR spectrum, there are two signals in the 1-3 ppm region, the 2 H quartet and 3 H triplet. They are characteristic for which alkyl group?
evalFeedback	2	7	The ^1H NMR spectrum shows two doublets in a ratio of 2:2 in the aromatic region. What does this tell you about the substitution pattern of the benzene ring?
evalFeedback	2	8	Your structure would not have the NMR spectrum of the one indicated in the picture. Try again.
qStmt	3		A student added 3-phenylpropanoic acid (PhCH2CH2COOH) to a molten salt consisting of a 1:1 mixture of NaCl and AlCl3 maintained at 170 &deg;C. After 5 minutes, he poured the molten mixture into water and extracted it into dichloromethane. Evaporation of the dichloromethane gave a 96% yield of the product whose spectra appear below. The mass spectrum of the product shows a molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 132. What is the product?
evalFeedback	3	1	Good! The dominant peak in the IR spectrum is at 1710 cm^^-1 which means there is a ketone and not an acid. The aromatic region in the NMR spectrum integrates to 4H, so the ring is disubstituted. The mass spectrum shows a molecular mass of 132 which means that the starting material lost a water molecule. Your structure matches all these characteristics.
evalFeedback	3	2	Your compound doesn't have an exact mass of 132.
evalFeedback	3	3	If Cl were present in the organic product, the molecular ion would show a large M+2 peak.
evalFeedback	3	4	How many peaks are there in the 13C NMR spectrum, and how many C atoms were in the starting material?  You must have that many C atoms in the product.
evalFeedback	3	5	The aromatic protons are present in the ^1H NMR spectrum. So the product should contain a benzene ring.
evalFeedback	3	6	Carboxylic acids have a strong, wide peak around 3300 cm^^-1 in IR. This absorption is missing from the indicated IR, so no carboxylic group should be present in your structure.
evalFeedback	3	7	What functional group is responsible for absorption at about 1700 cm^^-1 in IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	3	8	In the region of 2.6-3.2 ppm there are two signals each with integration value of 2 H; this means the two adjacent methylenes CH2CH2 are still present in the product.
evalFeedback	3	9	Your structure would show five aromatic protons. The indicated NMR spectrum shows only four. What does this tell you about the degree of substitution of the benzene ring?
evalFeedback	3	10	A pattern of four aromatic H atoms, all coupled to one another, is indicative of what substitution pattern about the aromatic ring?
evalFeedback	3	11	The ^1H NMR spectrum shows four aromatic protons. The starting material has five. No outside molecules are added to 3-phenylpropanoic acid. That means an intramolecular reaction would take place, so the product would have two rings.
qStmt	4		When anthracene is added to the reaction of chlorobenzene with concentrated NaOH at 350 &deg;C, an interesting Diels-Alder adduct of formula C20H14 results. The proton NMR spectrum of the product shows a singlet of area 2 around 3 ppm and a broad singlet of area 12 around 7 ppm. Propose a structure for the product.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right! Benzyne, formed from chlorobenzene and NaOH, is a highly reactive dienophile.  It reacts across the central ring to give triptycene.
evalFeedback	4	2	The product is a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	NaOH acts as a base; its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Cl acts as a leaving group, so it is not present into the final product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Your structure does not have the molecular formula of C20H14.
evalFeedback	4	6	Yes, the benzyne is formed as an intermediate. This will react further with anthracene so the triple bond is not present into the final product.
evalFeedback	4	7	What C atoms from anthracene are susceptible to electrophilic addition? Only those two C atoms will form a Diels-Alder adduct.
qStmt	5		Thymol gives the following mass, IR, and NMR spectra. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right! The base peak in MS is due to loss of methyl from the isopropyl group. The carbocation that is formed is very stable due to resonance. The IR shows a broad peak at 3500 cm^^-1 (O-H bond) and a peak at 1620 cm^^-1 (benzene ring). The three aromatic H's in the ^1H NMR spectrum confirm that there are three substituents on the benzene ring.
evalFeedback	5	2	The MS shows what exact mass?
evalFeedback	5	3	Although a peak in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the ^1H NMR spectrum can usually be attributed to an alkene, other functional groups can appear in this region.
evalFeedback	5	4	Your compound could not be a carboxylic acid because there is no absorption in the 1650-1800 cm^^-1 region of the IR spectrum.
evalFeedback	5	5	The broad peak at 3500 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum indicates the presence of which functional group?
evalFeedback	5	6	The peak at 1620 cm^^-1 indicates the presence of which functional group?
evalFeedback	5	7	In the ^1H NMR spectrum there are two signals in the alkyl region. What alkyl group is responsible for the 6 H doublet at 1.2 ppm and the 1 H multiplet at 3.2 ppm?
evalFeedback	5	8	By now you know that your structure should have a benzene ring and a OH group. From the MS you can see that the molecular mass is 150. What should be the molecular formula of your compound?
evalFeedback	5	9	The isomer you drew does not correspond to the indicated spectra.
qStmt	6		An unknown compound gives the following mass, IR, and NMR spectra. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right! The two prominent peaks in the MS are M-15 (loss of methyl) and M-43 (loss of acetyl). In the IR spectrum, the two most significant peaks are at 1680 cm^^-1 (conjugated carbonyl) and 1600 cm^^-1 (aromatic C=C). In the ^1H NMR spectrum, the 3 H singlet at 2.7 ppm is a methyl group next to a carbonyl group. The other signals are seven aromatic H atoms.
evalFeedback	6	2	You're very close! This isomer would have two shielded protons (8.7 ppm) in the ^1H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	6	3	The prominent peak in the MS spectrum at <i>m/z</i> 155 represents the loss of which group? This group is also responsible for the large singlet at 2.78 ppm in the ^1H NMR spectrum.  This group should be present in your structure.
evalFeedback	6	4	Look at the MS.  What should be the exact mass of your compound?
evalFeedback	6	5	What functional group has a peak at 1680 cm^^-1 in IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	6	6	What functional group has a peak at 1600 cm^^-1 in IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	6	7	So far you know that there is a methyl and a carbonyl in your molecule. The exact mass of the compound should be 170 as indicated by the molecular ion M^+. How many total C, H, and O atoms should be in your molecule?
evalFeedback	6	8	You know now that the molecular formula is C12H14O. There is a methyl group and a carbonyl group which require two C atoms. The rest of the ten C atoms will be in an aromatic compound (seven H atoms in the aromatic region of the ^1H NMR spectrum). What aromatic compound with 10 C atoms do you know?  Hint: Calculate the number of degrees of unsaturation in your compound, subtract one for the carbonyl group, and you will see how many rings and #pi bonds the aromatic portion of your compound must have.
evalFeedback	6	9	Your structure does not match the indicated spectra. Try again.

evalFeedback	1	1	Correct! The signals at ~7.2 ppm indicate a benzene ring.  A doublet at ~1.2 ppm integrating to six H atoms and a multiplet at ~2.8 ppm integrating to one H atom indicates an isopropyl group.
evalFeedback	1	2	What do the signals at ~7.2 ppm and the described chemistry indicate about the functional group present in the molecule?
evalFeedback	1	3	What would have to be the substitution pattern of an aromatic compound whose oxidative degradation gives benzoic acid?
evalFeedback	1	4	The spectrum shows a doublet and a multiplet integrating to six H atoms and one H atom, respectively.  What does it indicate about the structure of the hydrocarbon fragment present in the molecule?
evalFeedback	1	5	The integration of the H NMR spectrum shows that there should be how many H atoms in the compound?
qStmt	2		Benzene underwent a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction followed by a Clemmensen reduction.  The product gave the following <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum.  What acyl chloride was used in the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction?  <i>Hint</i>: It would be helpful if you first assign a structure to the compound shown in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! This acyl chloride is used in the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction.  The carbonyl group is then reduced to a methylene group by Clemmensen reduction to give butylbenzene.
evalFeedback	2	2	After Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with this compound followed by Clemmensen reduction, the product would contain four CH2 groups, but the H NMR spectrum shows only three.
evalFeedback	2	3	The compound you've drawn does not contain an acyl chloride functional group.
evalFeedback	2	4	The aromatic ring in the product comes from benzene, not from the acyl chloride that you are supposed to draw.
evalFeedback	2	5	The farthest upfield triplet integrating to three H atoms, a farthest downfield triplet integrating to two H atoms, and two multiplets integrating to two H atoms each.  This is the structure of the hydrocarbon fragment after Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by Clemmensen reduction.  Therefore, what could be the structure of the acyl chloride used in the reaction?
evalFeedback	2	6	The acyl chloride cannot contain as many C atoms as you have shown, because the product of Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene and Clemmensen reduction would show far more peaks in the alkyl region.

evalFeedback	10	1	Good! The lone pair on the nittrogen 3 atom  is not involved in resonance delocalization. However, the electrons shift from nitrogen 4 atom , shows that electrons spend more time on nitrogen 3 atom than any of the nitrogen atoms in the compound. This nitrogen will be the most basic in the compound. Nitrogen 4 atom has lone pair that is invloved in the resonance aromatic stabilization. Protonating this nitrogen destroys the aromaticity and destabilize the compound. Thus this nitrogen is least basic.

qdText	11	9	six
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  N^4 is the only N atom not participating in a #pi bond.  It assumes sp2-hybridization so that its lone pair can be in a p orbital, overlapping with the two other #pi bonds in the five-membered ring to make a cyclic array of p orbitals containing the magic number of six electrons.  Protonation of N^4 removes the p orbital from the cyclic array, making the five-membered ring nonaromatic, so N^4 is very prone <i>not</i> to be protonated.
evalFeedback	11	2	Please choose one option from each pulldown menu.
evalFeedback	11	3	The N atom you chose is participating in a #pi bond, so its lone pair cannot be conjugated to any of the #pi bonds.  (If it were, the atom would have to have sp hybridization, which would mean it would have to have a linear geometry, which is not possible in a ring.)  As a result, the lone pair of the N atom you chose is not involved in establishing the compound's aromaticity, and its protonation does not affect the compound's aromaticity.
evalFeedback	11	4	A basic compound tends to become protonated.  Protonation removes a lone pair of electrons.  Purine is already aromatic; how could removing a lone pair make it more aromatic?
evalFeedback	11	5	A basic compound tends to become protonated.  Protonation removes a lone pair of electrons.  If that lone pair is part of an aromatic ring, then removing it from the aromatic ring would not merely reduce the ring's aromaticity.
evalFeedback	11	6	Protonation of N^4 will not affect the aromaticity of the six-membered ring, which will still have three overlapping #pi bonds in a cyclic array.

evalFeedback	12	1	Although this compound can produce a nicely stabilized carbocation, it is not as low in energy as the carbocation produced by the other compound.
evalFeedback	12	2	Good! The rate-limiting step in SN1 substitution is ionization.  The carbocation produced by ionization of the C-Br bond in this compound is aromatic, so it is particularly low in energy, so it is easy for the starting bromide to ionize.

evalFeedback	16	1	Good! Removal of a methylene H atom from cyclopentadiene by a base gives a conjugate base with an electron pair on the carbon atom. This electron pair interacts with the #pi electrons to form a six-electron aromatic ring, making the conjugate base very low in energy and hence easier to form.

evalFeedback	3	13	Your mechanism appears to be correct!  Most chemists draw this reaction beginning with protonation of the OH of HNO3 and elimination of H2O to give NO2^+, followed by the usual addition-fragmentation steps. A more correct mechanism begins with protonation of the O^- of HNO3, addition of the O^- of another HNO3 to the N of HNO3H^+, and loss of H2O to give protonated nitric anhydride, HON^+(=O)ON^+(=O)O^-. The aromatic compound then adds the more reactive N^+, and then, after fragmentation to reform the aromatic ring, NO3^- leaves and H^+ is lost to give the final product.

evalFeedback	4	15	Your mechanism is mostly correct, but boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	4	16	Your mechanism appears to be correct!  AlCl3 complexes to the O atom of the carbonyl group to make it more electrophilic at C.  The benzene ring adds to the C, pushing electrons in the #pi bond toward O, and then a C-H bond of the ring fragments to give the substitution product.  Meanwhile, the O lone pair moves back to form a #pi bond with the C, expelling Cl to give the ketone-AlCl3 complex.  Finally, upon workup, H2O attacks Al and displaces the ketone O to give the indicated product.

Topic: Benzene and its derivatives; Set: Multistep synthesis
qStmt	1		Design a synthesis of the target compound from benzene and any other uncharged and metal-free compounds with two or fewer contiguous C atoms (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.
evalFeedback	1	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	1	2	Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions because the NH2 group coordinates to the AlCl3, making the NH2 group into a deactivating group.  To induce aniline to undergo a Friedel-Crafts reaction, you must first acetylate the NH2 group with Ac2O (simply mix) to give an NHAc group, then do the Friedel-Crafts reaction with Ac2O and AlCl3, and then convert the NHAc group back to NH2 with warm aq. NaOH.
evalFeedback	1	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	1	5	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  One approach is to recognize that F is an ortho-para director, so the last step can be a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the F can be introduced by diazonium ion chemistry, as follows: benzene &rarr; nitrobenzene &rarr; aniline &rarr; benzenediazonium &rarr; fluorobenzene (KBF4, #heat) + Ac2O &rarr; target (AlCl3).
qStmt	2		Design a synthesis of the target compound from benzene.  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.
evalFeedback	2	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	2	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	2	5	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  The meta substitution suggests that a nitro compound will have to be an intermediate.  One approach: benzene &rarr; nitrobenzene &rarr; 3-bromonitrobenzene &rarr; 3-bromoaniline (SnCl2) &rarr; 3-bromobenzenediazonium &rarr; target (CuCl).
qStmt	3		Design a synthesis of the target compound from benzene and any other uncharged and metal-free compounds containing no more than one C atom (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.
evalFeedback	3	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	3	2	The MeO group is an ortho-para director, but the para product predominates.  What group can you put para to the OMe group that you can later remove?
evalFeedback	3	3	It will be difficult to convert one NO2 group to Br and the other to H.  Try introducing two different groups to the ortho and para positions.
evalFeedback	3	5	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	3	6	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  The ortho substitution suggests that the last few steps will involve converting an NO2 or NH2 to H.  If the NO2 is para to the OMe, then the last few steps can be 4-nitroanisole &rarr; 2-bromo-4-nitroanisole &rarr; 3-bromo-4-methoxyaniline &rarr; 3-bromo-4-methoxybenzenediazonium &rarr; target (H3PO2).  To make 4-nitroanisole, use  benzene &rarr; bromobenzene &rarr; anisole (MeOH, Pd(0)/phosphine, base) &rarr; 4-nitroanisole.
qStmt	4		Design a synthesis of the target compound from benzene and any other uncharged and metal-free compounds containing no more than four C atoms (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.
evalFeedback	4	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	4	4	If you try to use 3-bromoaniline in a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling with pyrrolidine, not only the N of the pyrroldiine is likely to undergo substitution of the C-Br bond, but also the N of another molecule of the aniline.  It would be better to do the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling <i>before</i> the NH2 group is installed.
evalFeedback	4	6	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  The meta substitution suggests a nitroaromatic as an intermediate, and the pyrrolidino substituent suggests a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling.  One approach: benzene &rarr; nitrobenzene &rarr; 3-bromonitrobenzene + pyrrolidine &rarr; N-(3-nitrophenyl)pyrrolidine (cat. Pd(0), phosphine, base) &rarr; target (SnCl2 or H2, Pd/C).
qStmt	5		Design a synthesis of the target compound from compounds with six or fewer contiguous C atoms (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate. Hint: The Ph group is an ortho-para director.
evalFeedback	5	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	5	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	5	5	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  The Ph group is an ortho-para director (stabilizes adjacent positive charges), so the last step can be nitration of Ph-Ph.  The Ph-Ph bond can be made by Stille or Suzuki coupling.  One approach: bromobenzene + PhB(OH)2 &rarr; biphenyl &rarr; target.
qStmt	6		Design a synthesis of the target compound from compounds with six or fewer contiguous C atoms (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.  Hint: The Ph group is an ortho-para director.
evalFeedback	6	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	6	2	Nitrobenzene is too electron-poor to undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions (although it is not too electron-poor to undergo other kinds of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions such as bromination and nitration).  You will need to find another way to install the alkyl or acyl group.
evalFeedback	6	3	It will be difficult to differentiate the two halogen atoms in your 1,3-dihalobenzene intermediate.  If one reacts, there is nothing to stop the other one from reacting, too, and you are likely to end up with a mixture.  Try introducing each halogen atom one at a time, or use another method besides cross-coupling to introduce one of the substituents.
evalFeedback	6	5	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	6	7	Good!  It appears that your synthesis will work as written.  Both the Ph and <i>i</i>-Bu groups are ortho-para directors, so we will need an aromatic intermediate with an electron-withdrawing group.  One approach: 3-bromonitrobenzene + PhB(OH)2 &rarr; 3-nitrobiphenyl (cat. Pd(0), phosphine) &rarr; 3-aminobiphenyl &rarr; 3-biphenyldiazonium &rarr; 3-bromobiphenyl + <i>i</i>-BuSnMe3 &rarr; target (cat. Pd(0), phosphine).
qStmt	7		Design a synthesis of the target compound from benzene or toluene and uncharged and metal-free compounds containing no more than one C atom (not counting reagents that are part of reaction conditions).  If you use a diazonium ion, you must prepare it and then transform it in two separate steps, explicitly drawing the diazonium ion intermediate.

evalFeedback	7	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.

qStmt	13		Consider the reaction in the figure. Does the equilibrium for this reaction favor the right side of this equation, the left, or neither? Explain your answer; no credit will be given without a correct explanation.
evalFeedback	13	1	The equilibrium favors the left because NH3 is a stronger base than PhNH2.  It is stronger because the lone pair of PhNH2 participates in resonance, lowering its energy.
qStmt	14		Radicals are usually stabilized by resonance with adjacent benzene rings, but the radical in the figure is no more stable than if the benzene rings were not present. Why? (If you have Java enabled on your computer, you can launch MarvinView for the figure, then click-hold and drag to rotate the structure in 3D.)
evalFeedback	14	1	The p orbitals on the benzene rings are perpendicular to the orbital containing the unpaired electron, so resonance stabilization of the radical is not possible.

evalFeedback	15	1	Good!
evalFeedback	15	2	Consider the effects of size and electronegativity on acidity.
qStmt	16		Complete the following paragraph.<P>In cyclopropane, the C atoms are [[1, 2, 3]]-hybridized, which makes the optimum C-C&ndash;C bond angles to be [[4, 5, 6, 7]], but the ring forces the C-C&ndash;C bond angles to be 60&deg; instead. In order to bring their optimum angles closer to the actual angles, the ring bonds take on more [[8, 9, 10]] character, which causes the C-H bonds to have correspondingly much more [[11, 12, 13]] character, which makes them [[14, 15, 16]] a C-H bond in, say, CH3CH2CH3.

evalFeedback	16	1	Good!
evalFeedback	16	2	How many #sigma bonds and lone pairs not used in resonance does each C atom have?
evalFeedback	16	3	What are the optimum bond angles for sp3 hybridization?
evalFeedback	16	4	In hybrid orbitals, increased s character causes what to happen to the bond angles?  So how would you change bond character to cause the bond angles to decrease?
evalFeedback	16	5	If a larger proportion of the p orbitals goes to make the ring bonds, what must happen to the C-H bonds?
evalFeedback	16	6	How does increased s character affect acidity?
qStmt	17		Explain why the compound on the left is more acidic than the compound on the right.
evalFeedback	17	1	Esters are lower in energy than ketones due to resonance stabilization from the noncarbonyl O lone pairs, but the conjugate bases of esters and ketones are about the same in energy because the lone pair on C is equally stabilized by resonance in both, and the stabilization of the ester in the starting material is lost because the carbonyl group is completely occupied with the C lone pair. As a result, the ester loses stabilization when it undergoes deprotonation, unlike the ketone, so the ester is harder to deprotonate, hence less acidic.

You weigh 70 <i>kilos</i>, but NASA packed only enough food for a 70-<i>pound</i> person, so you arrive very thirsty and hungry.  The life forms on Htrae who greet you offer you a cup of local water and a slice of local meat.  Will Htrae water and meat be adequate substitutes for Earth water and meat?

evalFeedback	10	1	Water is achiral, so its mirror image is identical to itself, so Htrae water is identical to Earth water.  Meat is made up of chiral proteins, so its mirror image is NOT identical to itself, so Htrae meat is NOT an adequate substitute for Earth meat -- your body will not be able to digest the meat or incorporate its amino acids into your own proteins.

qStmt	19		When an enantiomerically pure sample of compound <b>A</b> is treated with NaOEt, the ee of <b>A</b> slowly declines until it reaches 0%.  What reversible reaction occurs under these conditions?  Explain how this reaction converts enantiomerically pure <b>A</b> to racemic <b>A</b>.  (Hint: Look at the reaction in the reverse direction.)
evalFeedback	19	1	The only stereocenter in A is the #a-C on the bottom right.  This position is also acidic.  When a base deprotonates it, it converts from sp3 to sp2 hybridization, losing its stereochemical memory.  When it is reprotonated, either enantiomer can be obtained.  As time goes on, more and more of the original enantiomer is converted to either enantiomer.

qStmt	11		The compound in the figure undergoes SN1 substitution much more slowly than one would expect a 3&deg; alkyl halide to do.  Why?  (You may want to rotate the structure in 3D to see it better.)
evalFeedback	11	1	The SN1 mechanism has a carbocation intermediate.  Carbocations are sp2-hybridized and planar.  The tricyclic shape of this compound prevents the bridgehead C from achieving planarity, which makes the carbocation much higher in energy than normal, which slows down SN1 substitution drastically.
qStmt	12		The compound in the figure undergoes E2 elimination much more slowly than one would expect a 3&deg; alkyl halide to do.  (Yes, it is the same compound as in the other question.)  Why?
evalFeedback	12	1	The C-H bonds of the adjacent C atoms cannot become anti to the C-Br bond, so E2 elimination is very slow.
qStmt	13		Rank the following compounds from most reactive in an SN1 substitution reaction (rank 1) to least reactive.
qdText	13	1	tetrahydropyran-2-ol
qdText	13	2	tetrahydropyran-3-ol

evalFeedback	13	1	Good!
evalFeedback	13	2	What intermediate is formed in the SN1 substitution reaction?  How would the different groups affect its energy?
qStmt	14		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger draws the isomer of dimethylbenzene shown in the Figure and tells her coworker, Will Wurklanghauers, that she wants to prepare it.  Will points out that Sally's target is so much higher in energy than dimethylbenzene (due to strain and other factors) that it will convert quickly to dimethylbenzene, and Sally won't be able to isolate it.  Sally agrees that the target compound is much higher in energy than dimethylbenzene, but she disagrees that that means that she won't be able to isolate it.  Who is right, and why?
evalFeedback	14	1	Sally is right.  Just because a compound is high in energy doesn't mean it can't be isolated.  A high-energy compound is stable if the transition states leading to decomposition products are high in energy relative to the compound.  In fact, that is the case with this compound.
qStmt	15		Sally tells Will that she plans to make the target compound by eliminating two equivalents of H2O from the diol shown in the figure.  Will tells her that her plan won't work under either acidic or basic conditions.  Why is Will so skeptical of Sally's plan?  Explain his reasoning for both acidic and basic conditions.
evalFeedback	15	1	Under acidic conditions, one would generate carbocations, which tend to undergo 1,2-shifts and other reactions that relieve ring strain.  Under basic conditions, OH is a poor leaving group.

qStmt	9		Your synthetic target is in box 4 (upper right).  The target can be made from two neutral, metal-free starting materials, both of which have up to five C atoms, in three steps.  In box 1, draw the two appropriate starting materials, and in boxes 2 and 3, draw the intermediate compounds that would eventually lead to the compound in box 4.
evalFeedback	9	1	Your response should contain five neutral, metal-free compounds: two in box 1, one each in boxes 2 and 3, and the target in box 4.
evalFeedback	9	2	Great!
evalFeedback	9	3	You're almost there.  What alkene stereoisomer would lead to the observed stereoisomer?
evalFeedback	9	4	The trans alkene that you drew would not lead to the observed product upon treatment with Br2. What alkene would?
evalFeedback	9	5	Please specify the stereochemistry of the alkene that, upon treatment with Br2, leads to the target.
evalFeedback	9	6	What compound would lead to the observed product upon treatment with Br2?
evalFeedback	9	7	What compound could you use to make the alkene that can be converted into the target?
evalFeedback	9	8	When the alkyne is deprotonated and treated with the electrophile, an elimination reaction will occur predominate.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	9	9	What two neutral, metal-free compounds can be used to make 2-methyl-3-hexyne?
qStmt	10		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger wants to make the two chloroalcohols shown.  Her labmate Will Wurklanghauers suggests that both compounds can be made from the single epoxide shown.  Explain under what conditions the epoxide can be converted to one or the other chloroalcohol, and explain why each reaction is selective for just one chloroalcohol under those reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	10	1	Under basic conditions, Cl^- reacts with the less hindered C atom of the epoxide, giving the first compound.  Under acidic conditions, Cl^- reacts with the more substituted C atom of the epoxide because it can better bear the partial positive charge, giving the second compound.
qStmt	11		The syn addition of two OH groups across an alkene can be accomplished by either of the two methods shown in the figure.  One of the methods is much better than the other.  Which?  Give two reasons why.
evalFeedback	11	1	(1) The second method uses catalytic amounts of Os, making it a much less expensive and less toxic reaction.  (2) The second method uses a nonvolatile form of Os, making it less dangerous.
qStmt	12		Will decides that he wants to carry out the reaction sequence shown in the figure.  Sally warns him that the sequence is not likely to work very well.  Is Sally right to be worried, and why?
evalFeedback	12	1	Sally is right to be worried because a 1,2-hydride shift is likely to occur in the first step, putting the Br on the most substituted C of the compound.
qStmt	13		One normally thinks of N as being more nucleophilic than O.  However, when the amide shown is treated with I2, the O of the amide, not the N, preferentially acts as a nucleophile.  Why?
evalFeedback	13	1	Because the ^+N=C-O^- resonance form of the amide shows that the O atom is more nucleophilic.  If the N atom reacts, it will put N^+ next to the partial C^+ of the carbonyl -- not good!
qStmt	14		Sally proposes to carry out the transformation shown in the Figure.  Will gives her two reasons why it won't work well.  What are his reasons?
evalFeedback	14	1	Won't be stereoselective, and a 1,2-hydride shift is likely to occur.
qStmt	15		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the following reaction.
evalFeedback	15	1	Your mechanism should lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	15	2	Your mechanism should utilize all three indicated starting materials.
evalFeedback	15	3	No carbocations should be generated under basic reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	15	4	No acids in this mechanism that takes place under basic conditions should have pKa &lt; 4.
evalFeedback	15	6	Your mechanism is missing the intermediate obtained after the new C-S bond forms.
evalFeedback	15	7	Your mechanism is missing the intermediate obtained after the new C-O bond forms.
evalFeedback	15	8	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	15	9	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	15	10	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	15	11	Good!

qStmt	11		Label the sp-hybridized atoms with map number 1, the sp2-hybridized atoms with map number 2, and the sp3-hybridized atoms with map number 3.  <P>To do so, type M and the number, and then click on each appropriate atom.  <P><b>Note:</b> Do not add explicitly drawn H atoms.

qStmt	12		The compound shown has two N atoms with lone pairs, but when it reacts with a proton H^+, it is always the N atom that does not bear the CH3 group that reacts.  Why?  (It has nothing to do with the bulkiness of the CH3 group.)
evalFeedback	12	1	<p>Both N atoms are sp2-hybridized.  The N bearing the CH3 group has a lone pair that can participate in resonance, but protonating this N makes its no longer able to participate in resonance.  The other N atom has a lone pair that cannot participate in resonance, and protonating it has no effect on the number of resonance structures that can be drawn.
qStmt	13		Organic Excel peer leader Sally Humdinger and organic chemistry student Nick O'Tyme are discussing the compound in the figure.  Nick thinks that it is an example of an aromatic compound; Sally disagrees.  Who is right, and why?  (No credit without a correct explanation.)
evalFeedback	13	1	<p>Nick is right.  You can draw a good resonance structure with alternating double bonds in the ring.
qStmt	14		The carbonyl group in the compound on the left is <b>lower</b> in energy than the carbonyl group in the compound on the right.  Why?
evalFeedback	14	1	<p>In the compound on the left, for the N to participate in resonance, it must promote its lone pair from an sp3 orbital to a p orbital.  In the compound on the right, for the N to participate in resonance, it must promote its lone pair from an sp2 orbital to a p orbital. The latter promotion is more difficult, so there is less resonance on the right, which makes this compound higher in energy.
qStmt	15		Explain why the S atom in the compound in the Figure assumes sp3 (not sp2) hybridization.
evalFeedback	15	1	<p>The S atom makes three #sigma bonds and has one lone pair not used in resonance, so it is sp3-hybridized.
qStmt	16		The carbonyl group in the compound in the Figure is much <b>higher</b> in energy than most other carboxamides.  Why?  (You can rotate the Figure in 3D to get a better idea of what it looks like.  Click and hold on the Figure, and drag.)
evalFeedback	16	1	<p>The shape of the compound forces the N lone pair to be in an orbital that is perpendicular to the orbitals making up the C=O #pi bond, so, unlike most carboxamides, the N cannot participate in resonance with the C=O group, making it unusually high in energy.
qStmt	17		How many valence electrons are present in C2H4O2?
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!
evalFeedback	17	2	Redo your math.
qStmt	18		The #sigma-bond network of one isomer of C2H4O2 is given to you.  Add the remaining valence electrons to complete the <i>best</i> Lewis structure of this compound.
evalFeedback	18	1	Good!
evalFeedback	18	2	Don't forget the unshared electrons!
evalFeedback	18	3	The compound must have the formula C2H4O2.
evalFeedback	18	4	The compound has a total charge of 0.
evalFeedback	18	5	Don't change the #sigma-bond network that was given to you.
evalFeedback	18	6	The total number of valence electrons shown in your structure (twice the number of bonds plus the number of unshared electrons) does not equal the number calculated from the formula and charge.
evalFeedback	18	7	The calculated formal charge (valence electrons of the element minus the number of bonds minus the number of unshared electrons) of each highlighted atom does not match the formal charge you have indicated for that atom.
evalFeedback	18	8	Each atom that is highlighted has too many electrons in its outer shell.
evalFeedback	18	9	Each atom that is highlighted is electron-deficient. In the best answer, each highlighted atom would not be electron-deficient.
evalFeedback	18	10	You've drawn a legitimate resonance structure, but not the best one.
qStmt	19		In the box on the left, draw electron-flow arrows to show how you can move electrons to generate the next best resonance structure of the given structure.  In the box on the right, draw the next best resonance structure of the given structure.
evalFeedback	19	1	Don't change the starting structure.
evalFeedback	19	2	You've simply redrawn the starting structure.
evalFeedback	19	3	You haven't drawn a resonance structure of the starting compound.
evalFeedback	19	4	You've drawn a resonance structure of the starting compound, but not the next best one.
evalFeedback	19	5	However, you have drawn the next best resonance structure of the starting structure.
evalFeedback	19	6	The box on the left should contain two two-electron electron-flow arrows.
evalFeedback	19	7	Good!

qStmt	14		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger makes a sample of erythrose by asymmetric synthesis.  She measures its optical rotation and finds that it shows [#a] = &ndash;27&deg;.  According to the literature, natural, enantiopure <small>D</small>-erythrose, whose structure is shown in the Figure, has [#a] = &ndash;30&deg;.  What is the ratio of enantiomers (er) in Sally's sample?  (Express it as a rational number greater than 1, e.g., 4, not 4:1.)
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  The ee of Sally's sample is 27/30 = 90%, so the er is (1 + 0.9) / (1 &ndash; 0.9) = 19.
evalFeedback	14	2	The enantiomeric excess (ee) is 90%, but I asked for the ratio of enantiomers (er).
evalFeedback	14	3	Report the ratio as a number greater than 1.
evalFeedback	14	4	No, try again.
qStmt	15		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger makes a sample of erythrose by asymmetric synthesis.  She measures its optical rotation and finds that it shows [#a] = &ndash;27&deg;.  According to the literature, natural, enantiopure <small>D</small>-erythrose, whose structure is shown in the Figure, has [#a] = &ndash;30&deg;.  Sally's sample is [[9,10,11]], the majority of molecules in Sally's sample of erythrose are [[5,6,7,8]] of natural erythrose, and the majority of molecules in Sally's sample of erythrose have the [[1,2,3,4]] configuration.

evalFeedback	15	1	Good!  Samples that rotate light in the negative direction are levorotatory.  If Sally's compound consisted of diastereomers or skeletal isomers of erythrose, it wouldn't be erythrose.  Given that the rotations have the same sign, they must be homomers, and the configurations must be the same.
evalFeedback	15	2	When a sample shows a negative optical rotation, what is it called?
evalFeedback	15	3	If Sally was making a diastereomer or a skeletal isomer of erythrose, would she be making erythrose?
evalFeedback	15	4	If the majority of Sally's sample were enantiomers of natural erythrose, in which direction would they rotate plane-polarized light?
evalFeedback	15	5	If most of Sally's sample is homomeric to natural erythrose, what must be the configuration of most of Sally's sample?
qStmt	16		The colorless compound on the left reacts with base to become the pink compound on the right.  Explain why the compound on the right is colored whereas the compound on the left is not.
evalFeedback	16	1	<p>The compound on the right is more conjugated, so its HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, which shifts the wavelength of light that is absorbed from UV on the left into the visible range on the right.
qStmt	17		In the interconversion between the two conformational diastereomers of an amide (in a dipeptide) shown, the equilibrium favors the compound on the left.  Why?
evalFeedback	17	1	<P>The second conformer has worse steric interactions.  The larger group attached to the middle N is CH2CO2H;  the larger group attached to the central carbonyl C is CH2NH2.  The two larger groups are close on the right than they are on the left.  If you draw the N=C(-O^-) resonance structure, the larger groups are trans on the left and cis on the right.
qStmt	18		In peptides (amides) such as the one shown, rotation about the N-C(=O) #sigma bond is much <b>slower</b> than rotation about other N-C and C-C bonds.  Why?  [Do <b>not</b> give the same answer as you did to the previous question; I am asking why rotation is slow, not which isomer is favored.]
evalFeedback	18	1	<p>The resonance structure for the amide bond shows that there is a partial double bond between the N and the carbonyl C.  This partial double bond breaks when rotation occurs, so rotation is slower than for simple single bonds.
qStmt	19		All three of the following equilibria favor the left side, but they differ in how strongly they do so.  Rank the following three equilibria from <b>favors the left the most</b> (rank 1) to <b>favors the left the least</b>.
qdText	19	1	glycylglycine
qdText	19	2	glycylproline
qdText	19	3	glycylvaline
evalFeedback	19	1	Good!  The smaller the difference in size between the two groups attached to the middle N, the less the equilibrium favors the left (or, the less it disfavors the right).
evalFeedback	19	2	No, try again.
qStmt	20		New undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers carries out the reaction shown in the Figure.  After isolating the product, he does paper chromatography and finds two products of unequal amounts.  He tells Sally that he has, (1) made an enantiomerically enriched sample of the product alcohol, and (2) separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Sally says that he must be wrong on both counts.  Who is right on point 1?
evalFeedback	20	1	<p>Sally is right.  All of Will's starting materials are achiral, so they must be optically inactive.  Optically inactive starting materials must give optically inactive products.  The product is chiral, so it must be racemic, a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers.
qStmt	21		New undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers carries out the reaction shown in the Figure.  After isolating the product, he does paper chromatography and finds two products of unequal amounts.  He tells Sally that he has, (1) made an enantiomerically enriched sample of the product alcohol, and (2) separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Sally says that he must be wrong on both counts.  Who is right on point 2?
evalFeedback	21	1	<p>Will is right that he could have separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Enantiomers differ in their interactions with chiral substances.  Paper is made of cellulose, which is chiral, so in principle, the two enantiomers could travel at different rates along the paper.  However, since we already know that Will could not have made two enantiomers in unequal amounts, Sally is right that the two unequal spots that Will observes cannot be the two enantiomers, so one spot must contain the unseparated enantiomers.

Precisely describe one feature (or the absence of a feature) of the MS, IR, ^1H NMR, or 13C NMR spectrum that will tell you unambiguously whether the compound in a bottle is the first or second compound.  <b>Note</b>: There may well be more than one answer to this question, but you must choose <b>ONE</b> spectroscopic method.  If you choose more than one method, you will not earn any credit.
evalFeedback	5	1	First compound has three ^1H and four 13C NMR resonances, whereas second compound has five ^1H and seven 13C resonances.  Second compound shows s, d, and dd in 1H NMR spectrum, whereas first compound shows only s and d.
qStmt	6		Your summer job is to clean up an organic chemistry laboratory after a flood has partially destroyed the labels on many of the bottles.

qStmt	8		Your summer job is to clean up an organic chemistry laboratory after a flood has partially destroyed the labels on many of the bottles.

qStmt	10		Label H atoms that <i>may</i> have different chemical shifts (are diastereotopic, are magnetically inequivalent) with different map numbers, and label H atoms that <i>must</i> have the same chemical shift (are homotopic or enantiotopic, are magnetically equivalent) with the same map numbers.  To label an atom with a number, right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the atom, select <b>Atom properties</b>, uncheck the box to the right of <b>Map</b>, enter the appropriate number, and press <b>Ok</b>. Enter 0 to delete a map number. You can also use the Select button to select two or more atoms and then follow the procedure above to give them the same map number all at once.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!

evalFeedback	11	1	Good!
qStmt	12		When an enantiomerically pure sample of compound <b>A</b> is treated with NaOEt, the ee of <b>A</b> slowly declines until it reaches 0%.  What reversible reaction occurs under these conditions?  Explain how this reaction converts enantiomerically pure <b>A</b> to racemic <b>A</b>.  (Hint: Look at the reaction in the reverse direction.)
evalFeedback	12	1	NaOEt acts as a base, deprotonating <b>A</b> at either C atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.  When the stereogenic C atom is deprotonated, it becomes nonstereogenic, so the compound becomes achiral.  The reverse reaction can occur as well, but when the achiral conjugate base reacts with EtOH to go back to <b>A</b>, the ^1H can attach to the top or bottom face of the carbanion, giving rise to either enantiomer.  Over time, <b>A</b> is converted to a racemic mixture.
qStmt	13		The structure of captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is shown.  If  one were to make captopril with <sup>15</sup>N-proline instead of the natural proline, how would the ^1H NMR spectrum of captopril be affected?  Be specific.
evalFeedback	13	1	^15N has a multiplicity of 1/2, so it will couple to nearby ^1H's.  For example, an adjacent ddd will become a dddd.
qStmt	14		The H atoms indicated by the arrow resonate at around 4.0 ppm, upfield of the usual alkene region.  Why do they resonate unusually far upfield?
evalFeedback	14	1	The N shares its lone pair by resonance, so the terminal C atom is particularly electron-rich, which causes the attached H atoms to be particularly shielded.
qStmt	15		When the reaction shown in Figure 1 is executed, the chemical shift of the H atom indicated by the arrow changes from an ordinary 2.35 ppm to a very downfield 3.22 ppm.  (Figure 2 merely shows a 3D representation of the product in Figure 1.)  How does the new group in the product exert this effect?
evalFeedback	15	1	The two #pi bonds of the alkyne in the product form a torus of electron density that, in the applied magnetic field, circulates to form its own magnetic field that opposes the applied magnetic field on the inside of the torus and enhances it on the outside.  The axial H atom sits close to and outside the alkyne, so it experiences an enhanced magnetic field, so it appears to be deshielded.
qStmt	16		In the box on the right, draw the products of the following acid&#8211;base reaction. In the box on the left, draw electron-flow arrows that show the movement of electrons among the starting materials that gives rise to the products.  <b>Note</b>: Do not alter the structures of the starting materials.  (However, you may draw in H atoms.)
evalFeedback	16	1	Do not alter the structures of the starting materials (except maybe for drawing in H atoms).
evalFeedback	16	2	You haven't drawn the proper products of the acid&#8211;base reaction.  What will be the structure of the conjugate acid of the starting base?
evalFeedback	16	3	You haven't drawn one of the correct products of the acid&#8211;base reaction.  Perhaps you should reconsider which atom in the carbonyl compound is most acidic.
evalFeedback	16	5	Good!
qStmt	17		Undergraduate researcher Will Wurklanghauers combined the starting materials shown in Figure 1, expecting to obtain the product shown.  He was bummed when he saw that the IR spectrum of the product that he obtained from the reaction lacked an absorbance around 2200 cm^^-1.  Senior undergraduate researcher Sally Humdinger told him that despite the IR spectrum, she still thought that the reaction proceeded as expected.  Why is Sally so unconcerned about the IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	17	1	The product alkyne has almost no dipole moment (nearly symmetrical), so one would not expect to see an IR absorbance for it.
qStmt	18		Draw a structure that is consistent with the MS in Figure 1.
evalFeedback	18	1	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	18	2	Please draw a single compound.

evalFeedback	19	7	Your structure does not match the indicated spectra.  Examine the ^1H NMR spectrum closely.

qStmt	1		Draw a reasonable mechanism for this reaction.  Note that the reaction proceeds in the <i>absence</i> of H2O, so do not use H2O in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	1	Your mechanism should lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	1	2	Your mechanism must use the amine (or its ammonium salt), H^+ (or the ammonium salt), and ^-C#tripleN (or Na-CN).
evalFeedback	1	3	No radicals should form in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	4	Primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond, as well as the CH3^+ ion, are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.

evalFeedback	1	6	What key intermediate precedes formation of the C-CN bond?
evalFeedback	1	8	This reaction proceeds in the absence of H2O.
evalFeedback	1	9	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 14.
evalFeedback	1	10	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.  Under acidic conditions, if you need to make and break a bond to C(sp3), first break the existing bond, then make the new bond in a separate step.
evalFeedback	1	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	1	12	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	1	13	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	1	14	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	1	15	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	1	16	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	1	17	Your mechanism appears to be correct!

evalFeedback	6	7	No C-C bonds are made or broken.
evalFeedback	6	8	Why would the CH3-N bonds break?

qStmt	9		Junior undergraduate research assistant Liza Roundalot carries out the reaction shown in the Figure.  When she does thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the material that she obtains after her reaction, she is bummed to see that she has obtained two products with distinct chemical properties, not just one.  When she shares her observation with senior undergraduate researcher Sally Humdinger, Sally tells her that she would have been surprised if Liza had <i>not</i> observed two products with distinct chemical properties.  Why is Sally so unsurprised by Liza's result?
evalFeedback	9	1	This reaction can give rise to two diastereomers, which will have different physical properties.
qStmt	10		Junior undergraduate research assistant Liza Roundalot now tries to carry out the reaction shown in the Figure.  The PhMgBr reacts with the ketone, but when Liza isolates her product after aqueous workup, she finds that she has obtained back the starting ketone!  What reaction does PhMgBr undergo with the ketone <i>instead</i> of addition to the carbonyl C?  (Hint: What is the reactivity of PhMgBr?  All such compounds are also what?)
evalFeedback	10	1	All nucleophiles are also bases.  The ketone is particularly acidic because of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base by the Ph group.  The PhMgBr merely deprotonates the ketone.  Upon aqueous workup, the conjugate base of the ketone is reprotonated, giving back the starting ketone.
qStmt	11		Junior undergraduate research assistant Liza Roundalot carries out the reaction shown in the Figure with many different R groups.  (It doesn't matter what reagent she uses or how this reaction works.)  When R = hexyl, phenyl, or another hydrocarbon group, and she isolates her ketone after aqueous workup and subjects it to MS, she sees a molecular ion that matches the expected mass of the ketone.  However, when R = CO2Et, the product that Liza isolates after aqueous workup shows a molecular ion at 192 amu instead of the expected 174 amu.  What has happened to the expected ketone in this case, and why does it happen when R = CO2Et and not when R is another group such as Ph or hexyl?
evalFeedback	11	1	The product has gained 192 &#8211; 174 = 18 amu, which is the weight of H2O.  H2O added to the product ketone upon aqueous workup to give a hydrate because the ketone was strongly destabilized by the two neighboring CO2Et groups.
qStmt	12		When primary amines react with ketones to give imines and H2O, the equilibrium usually favors the starting materials (Figure 1).  However, when the amine N is attached to a heteroatom, as in H2N-NH2, the equilibrium strongly favors the products (Figure 2).  The reason is that the overlap between the orbitals that contain the lone pairs in H2N-NH2 is reduced in the product.  Why is it reduced?  (Think about hybridization, energy, and their effect on orbital interactions.)
evalFeedback	12	1	Orbital overlap depends on how close in energy the orbitals are.  The overlap between the lone pairs is reduced in the product because in the starting material, both lone pairs are in sp3 orbitals, whereas in the product, the lone pair of the doubly bonded N is in an sp2 orbital, whereas the lone pair of the other N is in a p orbital.
qStmt	13		The two compounds shown in Figure 1 are both soluble in H2O, but when aqueous solutions of the two compounds are combined, an insoluble solid that contains the two compounds in a 1:1 ratio precipitates immediately.  What causes this phenomenon?
evalFeedback	13	1	The two compounds form strong hydrogen bonds and form an infinite 2D network which no longer has free N-H bonds that can hydrogen-bond to water, so it falls out of solution.
qStmt	14		Draw the ketone and the other starting material that could best be used to make the target compound by a reductive amination reaction.
evalFeedback	14	1	Excellent!  The target compound is methamphetamine, so now you know why phenylacetone is a controlled substance.
evalFeedback	14	2	Please draw exactly two starting materials.  (One or more other reagents may be involved as well, but I'm looking for the two starting materials from which are derived all of the C atoms in the target compound.)
evalFeedback	14	3	Formaldehyde is not a ketone.  What other disconnection can you use?
evalFeedback	14	4	You've correctly drawn one of the starting materials, phenylacetone.  What will be the other starting material?
evalFeedback	14	5	You've correctly drawn methylamine.  What will the other starting material be?
evalFeedback	14	6	Which bonds do you need to disconnect?  What functional groups would the starting materials have?
qStmt	15		[Note: It is better, but not necessary, to answer this question after you have correctly answered the third retrosynthesis question.]  Explain why methamphetamine made by a reductive amination reaction (Figure 1) has only half the potency of methamphetamine made from pseudoephedrine (FIgure 2).
evalFeedback	15	1	Methamphetamine made by reductive amination is racemic, and only one of the enantiomers has the effects desired by those who make methamphetamine.  Pseudoephedrine is enantiopure, and its deoxygenation leads only to one enantiomer of methamphetamine, the pharmacologically active one.
qStmt	16		Draw a reasonable mechanism for this reaction.
evalFeedback	16	1	Your mechanism should lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	16	2	Your mechanism should use both given starting materials.
evalFeedback	16	3	No radicals should form in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	16	4	Primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond, as well as the CH3^+ ion, are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.
evalFeedback	16	5	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	16	6	Which C-O bond should form first in this reaction?
evalFeedback	16	7	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What neutral compound is an intermediate in this reaction?
evalFeedback	16	9	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 5.
evalFeedback	16	10	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.  Under acidic conditions, if you need to make and break a bond to C(sp3), first break the existing bond, then make the new bond in a separate step.
evalFeedback	16	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	16	12	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	16	13	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	16	14	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	16	15	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	16	16	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	16	17	Your mechanism appears to be correct!
qStmt	17		In our last class on Thursday, we discussed the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (shown).  What parental admonition does the mechanism of this reaction disprove?
evalFeedback	17	1	It disproves the notion that once you lose your aromaticity, you can never get it back.

qStmt	12		The compound shown has two N atoms with lone pairs, labeled 1 and 3, but when the compound reacts with a proton H^+, it is always N^3 that reacts with the proton, and never N^1.  Why?  (It has nothing to do with the bulkiness of the CH3 group. Also, simply saying that N^3 is more basic than N^1 will earn you no credit, because it's just rewording what I have already told you, not providing an explanation.)
evalFeedback	12	1	In the starting compound, the lone pair on N^1 is used in resonance, and the lone pair on N^3 is not. If N^1 is protonated, N^1 can no longer participate in resonance. If N^3 is protonated, not only can the lone pair on N^1 still be used in resonance, but the positive charge on N^3 can be delocalized onto C^2 and N^1. More resonance means lower energy, so protonation of N^3 gives a lower energy compound than does protonation of N^1.
qStmt	13		The carbonyl group in the compound on the left is <b>lower</b> in energy than the carbonyl group in the compound on the right.  Why?
evalFeedback	13	1	The energy of carbonyl compounds depends on the stabilization of C^+ in the C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure. In the compound on the left, the lone pair needs to be promoted from an sp3 orbital to a p orbital in order to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group. In the compound on the right, the lone pair needs to be promoted from an sp2 orbital to a p orbital in order to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group. The second promotion is energetically more costly than the first promotion, so there is more resonance in the first compound than the second one, so the carbonyl group in the first compound is lower in energy than the carbonyl group in the second one.
qStmt	14		The amide group in the compound in the figure is much <b>higher</b> in energy than most other amides. Why? <p>[You can rotate the figure in 3D to get a better idea of what it looks like. If you have Java enabled on your computer, launch MarvinView, click and hold on the figure, and drag. If you don't have Java enabled on your computer, copy the structure, navigate to a page that has Marvin JS, paste the structure onto the canvas, click the Rotate 3D button (northern toolbar, to the right of the clean 2D and 3D buttons), click and hold on the figure, and drag.]
evalFeedback	14	1	If the N atom wants to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group, it needs to put its lone pair in a p orbital and have it align with the p orbitals of the carbonyl group. The N atom cannot put its lone pair in a p orbital because it would then be sp2-hybridized, requiring 120&#176; bond angles, which the bridged bicyclic structure of the compound prevents. The compound's structure also prevents the orbital containing the N lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl group's p orbitals.

qStmt	11		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger makes a sample of the HCl salt of <small>L</small>-ephedrine (see figure) by asymmetric synthesis.  She measures its enantomeric ratio (er) by chiral chromatography and finds that it is 9:1. According to the literature, the HCl salt of enantiopure <small>L</small>-ephedrine has [#a]<sub>D</sub> = &ndash;35&deg;.  What will be the observed specific activity of Sally's sample under the same conditions?
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  An er of 9:1 translates to an ee of 80%, so her sample's optical activity will be 80% of the enantiopure substance. Because she has the same enantiomer as the reference compound, the sign of rotation of her sample is the same as that of the reference compound.
evalFeedback	11	2	An er of 9:1 translates to an ee of 80%, so her sample's optical activity will be 80% of the enantiopure substance. Because she has the same enantiomer as the reference compound, the sign of rotation of her sample should be the same as that of the reference compound.
evalFeedback	11	3	Do you multiply the reference compound's specific rotation by the er, or the ee?
evalFeedback	11	4	Do you multiply the reference compound's specific rotation by the er, or the ee? Also, because she has the same enantiomer as the reference compound, the sign of rotation of her sample should be the same as that of the reference compound.
evalFeedback	11	5	How do you convert er into ee?
evalFeedback	11	6	The sign is correct, the magnitude is wrong.
qStmt	12		Sally also makes a sample of the HCl salt of <small>D</small>-pseudoephedrine (see figure), a diastereomer of <small>L</small>-ephedrine. The sign of the optical rotation of Sally's sample will be [[1,2,3,4]], and the magnitude will be [[5,6,7]] that of the HCl salt of <small>L</small>-ephedrine.

qStmt	13		You visit the planet Htrae, where every compound is the mirror image of the corresponding compound on Earth. You are addicted to nicotine, but NASA has banned smoking on its flights, and you forgot to pack some Nicorette gum, so you arrive needing a cigarette, bad. The locals offer you a cigarette made from locally grown tobacco. Will the hit of nicotine from the cigarette make you feel much better, much worse, about the same, or is it not possible to predict? And will the cigarette be more carcinogenic, less carcinogenic, about the same, or is it not possible to predict? The structures of the main addictive and carcinogenic substances in cigarettes are shown in the Figures.
evalFeedback	13	1	Nicotine is chiral, so the Htrae nicotine will be the enantiomer of Earth nicotine. It is impossible to predict how the enantiomer of nicotine will behave in your body -- it could be similar to regular nicotine, it could be totally ineffectual, or could cause you to grow nipples on your butt. The carcinogen, on the other hand, is achiral, so the Htrae carcinogen is identical to Earth carcinogen, and it will have an identical effect.
qStmt	14		New undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers carries out the reaction shown in the Figure.  After isolating the product, he does paper chromatography and finds two products of unequal amounts.  He tells Sally that he has, (1) made an enantiomerically enriched sample of the product alcohol, and (2) separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Sally says that he must be wrong on both counts.  Who is right on point 1?
evalFeedback	14	1	<p>Sally is right.  All of Will's starting materials are achiral, so they must be optically inactive.  Optically inactive starting materials must give optically inactive products.  The product is chiral, so it must be racemic, a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers.
qStmt	15		New undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers carries out the reaction shown in the Figure.  After isolating the product, he does paper chromatography and finds two products of unequal amounts.  He tells Sally that he has, (1) made an enantiomerically enriched sample of the product alcohol, and (2) separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Sally says that he must be wrong on both counts.  Who is right on point 2?
evalFeedback	15	1	<p>Will is right that he could have separated the enantiomers with paper chromatography.  Enantiomers differ in their interactions with chiral substances.  Paper is made of cellulose, which is chiral, so in principle, the two enantiomers could travel at different rates along the paper.  However, since we already know that Will could not have made two enantiomers in unequal amounts, Sally is right that the two unequal spots that Will observes cannot be the two enantiomers, so one spot must contain the unseparated enantiomers.

evalFeedback	8	16	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

qdText	11	3	4-chloro-1-ethyl-3-methylpyrrolidine
qdText	11	4	4-chloro-1-ethyl-3-methyl-2-pyrroline
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!
evalFeedback	11	2	The compound with the NCH2Cl group generates a carbocation that has one good resonance structure, in which every atom has its octet. The compound with the double bond generates a carbocation that has <i>two</i> good resonance structures, and, in one of them, every atom has its octet. The latter compound generates a lower energy carbocation than the former one.
evalFeedback	11	3	No, try again.
qStmt	12		Explain the difference in the outcomes of the two reactions. Why does the top reaction do exclusively elimination, whereas the bottom reaction does mostly substitution?
evalFeedback	12	1	Both reactions are under basic conditions. Under basic conditions, there is a competition between SN2 and E2. C is a first row element, so it is always a good base. The bottom nucleophile is more hindered than the top, but it undergoes substitution, so hindrance must not be an issue. Both compounds are therefore good nucleophiles and good bases, and we are in the middle square of the Organic Squares&trade;. Here E2 usually predominates over SN2, but the less basic the nucleophile, the more SN2 one gets. The bottom nucleophile is much less basic than the top one because of the additional resonance stabilization afforded by the second carbonyl group, and because it is less basic, it gives more substitution than the top nucleophile.
qStmt	13		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1. Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the desired product won't be the major product. Why is Sally so critical?
evalFeedback	13	1	Under acidic conditions, there is a competition between SN1 and E1. SN1 predominates if there is a high concentration of nucleophile. In this case, there is a nucleophile (primary alcohol) in the same compound as the electrophile (tertiary alcohol), so it is in high concentration, and substitution will predominate.
qStmt	14		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the elimination step won't be selective for the desired diastereomer under <i>either</i> acidic <i>or</i> basic conditions.  Explain Sally's reasoning for <i>acidic</i> conditions.
evalFeedback	14	1	Zaitsev's rule applies to eliminations under acidic conditions. The diastereomer of the product that Jess desires is the higher energy one, so it will be the minor product, not the major one.
qStmt	15		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the elimination step won't be selective for the desired diastereomer under <i>either</i> acidic <i>or</i> basic conditions.  Explain Sally's reasoning for <i>basic</i> conditions.  (The answer is <i>not</i> the same as the answer under acidic conditions.)
evalFeedback	15	1	Under basic conditions, when both the electrophilic C and the C from which the H is being removed are stereogenic, then the stereochemistry of the starting material determines the stereochemistry of the product. Jess has a mixture of diastereomeric alcohols, so one will give her desired product, but the other will give its diastereomer.
qStmt	16		Most primary alkyl halides do not undergo SN1 substitution, but the one in the Figure does. Why?
evalFeedback	16	1	The rate of an SN1 reaction depends on the energy of the intermediate carbocation. Primary carbocations are normally very high in energy, but the one derived from departure of Cl^- from this compound is not, because the neighboring O can share a lone pair with the carbocation in resonance, thereby lowering its energy.
qStmt	17		Draw a reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction shown. The correct response may or may not require all of the columns that have been provided. Start your diagram in the leftmost column. Click in the center of a column to add an energy maximum or minimum, and choose the appropriate name for that energy maximum or minimum from the pulldown menu. Pay attention to the relative energies of the maxima and minima. Assume that the products are lower in energy than the starting materials. Please note that although this reaction looks similar to the one on the homework, it is not the same.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!
evalFeedback	17	2	Close, but won't the protonated alcohol be higher in energy than the starting alcohol?
evalFeedback	17	3	What should be the relative energies of the two highest energy TSs?
evalFeedback	17	4	The mechanism of this reaction consists of three steps, not two.
evalFeedback	17	5	No, sorry.

evalFeedback	9	8	No C-C bonds ar made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	9	What adds across the &#960; bond in this reaction?
qStmt	10		When the alkene shown in the Figure undergoes hydroboration-oxidation, the OH group ends up attached to the <i>more</i> substituted C atom, even though hydroboration-oxidation usually puts the OH group on the <i>less</i> substituted C atom.  Why does this alkene appear to behave differently from most?
evalFeedback	10	1	When a B-H bond adds across a double bond, the more electropositive B atom acts as an electrophile and the more electronegative H atom acts as a nucleophile, so the H adds to the C better able to bear a + charge. Normally the more substituted side of the alkene is better able to bear a + charge, but in this case, the C atom attached to MeO is better able to bear a + charge due to resonance with the O lone pairs. Therefore the H adds to the less substituted C and the B to the more substituted C, and when the B is replaced with OH, the observed product is obtained.
qStmt	11		Undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov finds an unopened bottle of the material in the Figure, and she uses some of it as a solvent. The next day, she finds large white crystals growing in the remaining material in the bottle. What happened?
evalFeedback	11	1	The compound underwent autoxidation, substitution of the H attached to the C adjacent to O with an OOH group. This reaction is very fast because the intermediate radical is very low in energy, being highly substituted and adjacent to O.

qStmt	15		Complete the following paragraph.<P>In the compound shown in the figure, the C atoms are [[1, 2, 3]]-hybridized, which makes the optimum C-C&ndash;C bond angles [[4, 5, 6, 7]], but the ring forces the C-C&ndash;C bond angles to be 60&deg; instead. In order to bring their optimum angles closer to the actual angles, the ring bonds take on more [[8, 9, 10]] character, which causes the C-H bonds to have correspondingly much more [[11, 12, 13]] character, which makes them [[14, 15, 16]] a C-H bond in, say, CH3CH2CH3.

evalFeedback	15	1	Good!
evalFeedback	15	2	In hybrid orbitals, increased s character causes what to happen to the bond angles?  So how would you change bond character to cause the bond angles to decrease?

evalFeedback	15	4	What are the optimum bond angles for sp3 hybridization?
evalFeedback	15	5	In hybrid orbitals, increased s character causes what to happen to the bond angles?  So how would you change bond character to cause the bond angles to decrease?

evalFeedback	15	7	How does increased s character affect acidity?
qStmt	16		The compound on the left is much more acidic than the one on the right. Why?
evalFeedback	16	1	<p>Both compounds, when deprotonated, can stabilize the newly revealed lone pair by resonance into the ring. However, in the compound on the left, resonance also delocalizes the lone pair onto the N atom of the C#tripleN group. In the compound on the right, it does not.
qStmt	17		Consider the reaction in the figure. The pKa of the hydrocarbon on the upper left is 15; the pKa of ethanol, on the lower right, is 17. Does the equilibrium for this reaction favor the right side of this equation, the left, neither, or both?

Given that natural, enantiopure <small>D</small>-erythrose, whose structure is shown in Figure 2, has [#a] = &minus;30&#176;, should Will predict that his compound is dextrorotatory, that it is levorotatory, that it is optically inactive, or that there is no way to tell?

evalFeedback	15	1	<p>Rotation occurs slowly about the N-C(=O) bond. The N lone pair is involved in resonance with the C=O group. If you draw the resonance structure, you will see that it has a double bond between N and the carbonyl C. Rotation about double bonds is very slow.
qStmt	16		Draw the compound in the Figure (or its enantiomer) in its <b><i>lowest</i></b> energy conformation. Follow this procedure:
<ol><li>Click on the appropriate chair in the southern toolbar, and click on the drawing canvas. 
</li><li>Press the Add/Remove explicit H button (its icon is H&plusmn;) on the northern toolbar. If you don't see it, scroll the toolbar with the right arrow button in the far upper right corner.
</li><li>To add an atom, press the button for that atom, or type its symbol. To add an abbreviated group such as <i>i-</i>Pr, press the first button in the southern toolbar, type <b>iPr</b>, and press <b>Ok</b>.
</li><li>Click on an H atom to replace that H atom with the atom or abbreviated group at the tip of the cursor.  
</li></ol>

evalFeedback	16	1	Please draw a single structure.
evalFeedback	16	2	The compound you drew does not have the same structure as the given compound.
evalFeedback	16	3	The compound you drew is neither the given compound nor its enantiomer.

evalFeedback	16	5	You've drawn the higher energy conformer.
evalFeedback	16	6	Please draw the compound in its lowest-energy conformation.
qStmt	17		Using the table, calculate the difference in energy between the two conformers in the Figure.
<P><table style="margin-left:15px;"><tr><th>Interaction</th><th>Cost in kcal/mol</th></tr>
<tr><td>CH3-H 1,3-diaxial*</td><td style="text-align:right;">0.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>CH3-CH3 gauche</td><td style="text-align:right;">0.9</td></tr>

<tr><td>iPr-H 1,3-diaxial*</td><td style="text-align:right;">1.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>iPr-CH3 gauche</td><td style="text-align:right;">1.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>iPr-CH3 1,3-diaxial*</td><td style="text-align:right;">5.0</td></tr></table>
<P>*The cost of a <b>single</b> 1,3-diaxial interaction.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!
evalFeedback	17	2	You neglected to consider the gauche interactions.
evalFeedback	17	3	Perhaps you neglected to consider all of the 1,3-diaxial interactions in the conformer on the right.
evalFeedback	17	4	No. In the conformer on the left, there are four 1,3-diaxial and two gauche interactions. In the conformer on the right, there are three 1,3-diaxial (one is quite large) and three gauche interactions. Add up the costs in each conformer, and subtract them.
qStmt	18		When an enantiomerically pure sample of the ketone in the Figure is treated with a base such as NaOEt, the sample's ee declines until it reaches 0%. <ol><li>What reversible reaction occurs between the ketone and NaOEt? </li><li>Explain how this reaction converts enantiomerically pure ketone to racemic ketone. (Hint: Look at the reaction in the reverse direction.)</li></ul>
evalFeedback	18	1	<p>The only stereocenter in the ketone is the #a-C on the bottom right.  This position is also acidic.  When EtO^- deprotonates it, it converts from sp3 to sp2 hybridization, becoming achiral.  When it is reprotonated, it has equal probability of reacting with the proton on the top or bottom face, so either enantiomer can be obtained.  As time goes on, more and more of the original enantiomer is converted to either enantiomer.
qStmt	19		The lowest energy conformer of 1,2-ethanediol (Figure) is chiral, but no organic chemist would describe 1,2-ethanediol as a chiral compound. Why not?
evalFeedback	19	1	<p>Because free rotation about the C-C bond interconverts the enantiomers on an extremely fast time scale. The compound's energetically accessible anti conformation is achiral, and we consider a compound that has at least one energetically accessible achiral conformation to be achiral.
qStmt	20		The compound in Figure 1 is much higher in energy than its isomer in Figure 2.  Why? (You might find it helpful to manipulate either compound in 3D. To do so, click on the figure, copy the text, use a <i>different browser</i> to go to a page that has MarvinJS, click on the drawing canvas, and paste the text that you copied.)
evalFeedback	20	1	<p>All of the six-membered rings in the first compound (called twistane) are twist-boats, so they experience steric and torsional strain. All of the six-membered rings in the second compound (called adamantane), on the other hand, are chairs.

qdText	12	2	tetrahydropyran-3-ol
qdText	12	3	cyclohexanol
qdText	12	4	2-cyclohexen-1-ol
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!
evalFeedback	12	2	If O isn't adjacent to an electron-deficient C atom, it can't use its lone pairs to stabilize it. In that case, what effect will its electronegativity have on the C^+?
evalFeedback	12	3	If O isn't adjacent to an electron-deficient C atom, it can't use its lone pairs to stabilize it. In that case, what effect will its electronegativity have on the C^+?
evalFeedback	12	4	What intermediate is formed in the SN1 substitution reaction?  How would the different groups affect its energy?
qStmt	13		The compound in the figure undergoes SN1 substitution much more slowly than one would expect a 3&deg; alkyl halide to do. Why? (You may want to rotate the structure in 3D to see it better. If you do, click on the image, copy the code, navigate to a page with a MarvinJS window, paste the structure into the window, press the Clean 3D button, and press the Rotate in 3D button.)
evalFeedback	13	1	The rate-limiting step in the SN1 mechanism is the formation of a carbocation intermediate.  Carbocations are sp2-hybridized and planar.  The tricyclic shape of this compound prevents the bridgehead C from achieving planarity, which makes the carbocation much higher in energy than normal, which slows down SN1 substitution drastically.
qStmt	14		The compound in the figure undergoes E2 elimination much more slowly than one would expect a 3&deg; alkyl halide to do.  (Yes, it is the same compound as in the other question.) Why? (You may want to rotate the structure in 3D to see it better. If you do, click on the image, copy the code, navigate to a page with a MarvinJS window, paste the structure into the window, press the Clean 3D button, and press the Rotate in 3D button.)
evalFeedback	14	1	The C-H bonds of the adjacent C atoms cannot become anti to the C-Br bond, so E2 elimination is very slow. Alternatively, if the compound does undergo elimination, it would not be possible for the two double-bond C atoms and the four atoms attached them to become coplanar.
qStmt	15		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger draws the isomer of dimethylbenzene shown in the Figure and tells her coworker, Will Wurklanghauers, that she wants to prepare it.  Will points out that Sally's target is so much higher in energy than dimethylbenzene (due to strain and other factors) that it will convert quickly to dimethylbenzene, and Sally won't be able to isolate it.  Sally agrees that the target compound is much higher in energy than dimethylbenzene, but she disagrees that that means that she won't be able to isolate it.  Who is right, and why?
evalFeedback	15	1	Sally is right.  Just because a compound is high in energy doesn't mean it can't be isolated.  A high-energy compound is stable if the transition states leading to decomposition products are high in energy relative to the compound.  In fact, that is the case with this compound.
qStmt	16		Sally tells Will that she plans to make the target compound by eliminating two equivalents of H2O from the diol shown in the figure.  Will tells her that her plan won't work under either acidic or basic conditions.  Why is Will so skeptical of Sally's plan?  Explain his reasoning for both acidic and basic conditions.
evalFeedback	16	1	Under acidic conditions, one would generate carbocations, which tend to undergo 1,2-shifts and other reactions that relieve ring strain.  Under basic conditions, OH is a poor leaving group.

evalFeedback	6	5	What compound is obtained after the C&#8211;O bond forms?
evalFeedback	6	7	You have drawn a mechanism with a linear topology. This mechanism involves radicals, so it is much more likely to proceed by a chain mechanism.

qStmt	10		The syn addition of two OH groups across an alkene can be accomplished by either of the two methods shown in the figure.  One of the methods is much better than the other.  Which?  Give two reasons why.
evalFeedback	10	1	(1) The second method uses catalytic amounts of Os, making it a much less expensive and less toxic reaction. (2) The second method uses a nonvolatile form of Os, making it less dangerous.
qStmt	11		Will decides that he wants to carry out the reaction sequence shown in the figure.  Sally warns him that the sequence is not likely to work very well.  Is Sally right to be worried, and why?
evalFeedback	11	1	Sally is right to be worried because a 1,2-hydride shift is likely to occur in the first step, putting the Br on the most substituted C of the compound.
qStmt	12		One normally thinks of N as being more nucleophilic than O.  However, when the amide shown is treated with I2, the O of the amide, not the N, preferentially acts as a nucleophile.  Why?
evalFeedback	12	1	Because the ^+N=C-O^- resonance form of the amide shows that the O atom is more nucleophilic.  If the N atom reacts, it will put N^+ next to the partial C^+ of the carbonyl -- not good!
qStmt	13		Sally proposes to carry out the transformation shown in the Figure.  Will gives her two reasons why it won't work well.  What are his reasons?
evalFeedback	13	1	Won't be regioselective, won't be stereoselective, and a 1,2-hydride shift is likely to occur.
qStmt	14		In the radical cyclization reaction shown here, both the five-membered and six-membered radicals can be obtained. The major product is always the five-membered ring, even though the five-membered ring is more strained. Draw a reaction coordinate diagram illustrating these facts.

evalFeedback	14	2	The cyclization is energetically favorable (because a new C-C #sigma bond is formed at the expense of a C=C bond), so what should be the height of the acyclic radical relative to the cyclic ones?

evalFeedback	14	4	Which forms faster, the five-membered ring or the six-membered ring?
evalFeedback	14	5	Can the two cyclizations go through the same TS if they proceed at different rates?
evalFeedback	14	6	Which is lower in energy, the five-membered ring or the six-membered ring? Also, the cyclization is energetically favorable (because a new C-C #sigma bond is formed at the expense of a C=C bond), so what should be the height of the acyclic radical relative to the cyclic ones?

qStmt	14		When asked whether C^2 or C^6 is more acidic, undergraduate student Jess Gudinov predicts that C^2 is more acidic, because it uses an sp2 hybrid orbital to hold the lone pair obtained upon deprotonation of C^2, whereas C^6 uses a higher energy sp3 orbital to hold the lone pair obtained upon deprotonation of C^6. In fact, Jess is wrong; C^2 is <i>less</i> acidic than C^6. What factor did Jess not consider that makes C^6 more acidic than C^2? Explain your answer in no more than three short, grammatically correct sentences.
evalFeedback	14	1	When C^6 is deprotonated, the resulting lone pair can be stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl group. When C^2 is deprotonated, it looks like the resulting lone pair could be stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl group as well, but the hybridization of C^2 would then have to be sp, with 180&#176; bond angles, which is not possible in this cyclic compound.

evalFeedback	15	3	You forgot to raise to the power of 10.
evalFeedback	15	4	You forgot to raise to the power of 10. Also, what should be the sign of the exponent?

evalFeedback	16	1	Good!
evalFeedback	16	2	No.
qStmt	17		The compound on the left is much more acidic than the one on the right. Why?
evalFeedback	17	1	When the compound on the left is deprotonated, it is possible to draw a resonance structure in which the lone pair is delocalized onto the electronegative N atom. It is not possible to draw such a resonance structure for the conjugate base of the compound on the right.

qStmt	18		Bicyclic compounds with a double bond at a bridgehead C, like the one shown in the Figure, are extremely high in energy. Explain why.
evalFeedback	18	1	The geometry of the compound prevents the p orbitals of the two alkene C atoms from being parallel to one another, which means there's really no &#960;&#160;bond there at all.

qStmt	21		You visit the planet Htrae, where every compound is the mirror image of the corresponding compound on Earth. You needed 100 kilos of food and water for the journey, but NASA packed only 100 <i>pounds</i>, so you arrive on Htrae very hungry and thirsty. A Htrae life form offers you some locally grown food and a glass of local water. Will the food satisfy your hunger, make you more hungry, or leave you feeling about the same, or is it not possible to predict? And will the water satisfy your thirst, make you more thirsty, or leave you feeling about the same, or is it not possible to predict?
evalFeedback	21	1	Water is achiral, so the mirror image of water is identical to water, so Htrae water will have exactly the same effects as Earth water. Food is made up of proteins and sugars (along with other things), which are chiral compounds, so their mirror images are enantiomeric, and enantiomers interact in different ways with chiral objects such as yourself, so there is no way of predicting the effects of the Htrae food. It probably wouldn't be nourishing, though, because your body could not use it.

The latter compound generates a lower energy carbocation than the former one.
evalFeedback	10	3	The compound with the double bond generates a carbocation that has <i>two</i> good resonance structures, and, in one of them, every atom has its octet. The latter compound generates a lower energy carbocation than any other compound in this list.
evalFeedback	10	4	No, try again.
qStmt	11		Explain the difference in the outcomes of the two reactions. Why does the top reaction do exclusively elimination, whereas the bottom reaction does mostly substitution?
evalFeedback	11	1	Both reactions are under basic conditions. Under basic conditions, there is a competition between SN2 and E2. O is a first row element, and both compounds are unhindered, so both compounds are good nucleophiles and good bases, and we are in the middle square of the Organic Squares&trade;. Here E2 usually predominates over SN2, but the less basic the nucleophile, the more SN2 one gets. The bottom nucleophile is much less basic than the top one <b>because of the additional resonance stabilization afforded by the aromatic ring</b>, and because it is less basic, it gives more substitution than the top nucleophile.
qStmt	12		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1. Graduate student Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the desired product won't be the major product. Why is Sally so critical?
evalFeedback	12	1	Under acidic conditions, there is a competition between SN1 and E1. SN1 predominates if there is a high concentration of nucleophile. In this case, there is a nucleophile (primary alcohol) in the same compound as the electrophile (tertiary alcohol), so it is in high concentration, and substitution will predominate.
qStmt	13		Most primary alkyl halides do not undergo SN1 substitution, but the one in the Figure does. Why?
evalFeedback	13	1	The rate of an SN1 reaction depends on the energy of the intermediate carbocation. Primary carbocations are normally very high in energy, but the one derived from departure of Cl^- from this compound is much lower in energy, because it can engage in resonance with the &#960; bonds in the ring.
qStmt	14		Draw a reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction shown in the Figure. The correct response may or may not require all of the columns that have been provided. Start your diagram in the leftmost column. Click in the center of a column to add an energy maximum or minimum, and choose the appropriate name for that energy maximum or minimum from the pulldown menu. Pay attention to the relative energies of the maxima and minima. Assume that the <b>products are lower in energy than the starting materials</b>.
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!
evalFeedback	14	2	If the products are lower in energy than the starting material, would the TS leading from intermediate to products be higher, lower, or the same in energy as the TS leading from intermediate back to starting materials?
evalFeedback	14	3	What is the mechanism of this elimination reaction? How many steps does it require?
evalFeedback	14	4	There should be at most one species in each column.
qStmt	15		Undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers proposes to carry out the reaction shown in the Figure. Graduate student Sally Humdinger tells him that it's unlikely to work as written, but that Will can fix the problem pretty easily. Why does Sally say the reaction won't work, and what should Will change to make it work?
evalFeedback	15	1	Under the given basic conditions, the nucleophile will react with the epoxide by the SN2 mechanism, which proceeds faster at the less substituted C of the epoxide. To make the nucleophile react with the epoxide at the more substituted C of the epoxide, run the reaction under acidic conditions.

evalFeedback	2	14	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.

evalFeedback	2	16	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	2	17	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

However, when she treated the product that she obtained with MeONa, intending to make an ether, she recovered an alkene, one that was different from the one with which she started. Why did Chava not obtain the intended product, and what did she obtain instead?
evalFeedback	11	1	HCl does not undergo free-radical addition to alkenes, so Chava obtained the product of polar addition, i.e., the Markovnikov product (3&#176; alkyl chloride), instead of the anti-Markovnikov one (1&#176; alkyl chloride).

evalFeedback	22	5	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What intermediate is obtained after the second new C-O bond forms?
evalFeedback	22	7	You have drawn a linear mechanism. This mechanism involves radicals, so it is much more likely to proceed by a chain mechanism.

All its C atoms should derive from <i><b>benzene</b></i> or from starting materials containing <i><b>no more than two contiguous C atoms</b></i>.  (You may use larger starting materials as long as their C atoms are not incorporated into the product.)

evalFeedback	11	5	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	11	6	Your synthesis works, but it has too many steps.  There is a more efficient route.

qStmt	17		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the reaction in the figure.
evalFeedback	17	1	Your mechanism must lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	17	2	We don't draw H^+ under basic conditions.  What compound in the reaction mixture can act as a source of protons?
evalFeedback	17	3	No carbocations should be generated under basic reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	17	4	Your mechanism should use all three indicated starting materials.
evalFeedback	17	5	HO^- is not a good enough base to deprotonate a neutral N atom.  However, N can act as a nucleophile even in its neutral state.
evalFeedback	17	6	You may not generate very strong bases under these conditions.   The reaction conditions are only mildly basic.  H2O can serve as a source of protons.
evalFeedback	17	7	No reaction takes place until the starting material is added to aqueous base, so the compound must react with H2O or HO^- before it does any internal reactions.
evalFeedback	17	9	Don't try to do too many steps all at once.  The addition of H2O or HO^- to the electrophilic C atom and the attack of N on the alkyl halide take place in separate steps.
evalFeedback	17	10	Don't try to do too many steps at once.  The deprotonation of the N and the attack on the electrophilic C atom happen in two separate steps.
evalFeedback	17	11	Don't try to do too many steps at once.  The cleavage of a C-N bond and the protonation of N happen in two separate steps.  
evalFeedback	17	12	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	17	13	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	17	14	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	17	15	Good!  The N is protonated, and HO^- adds to give a hemiaminal.  At this point the N atom can displace Br in an intramolecular SN2 reaction, then OH is deprotonated and expels the amine to give the ketone.  It's also acceptable to form the ketone and the primary amine before closing the new ring and displacing Br^-.
qStmt	18		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the reaction in the figure.
evalFeedback	18	1	Your mechanism must lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	18	2	Your mechanism should use all three indicated starting materials.
evalFeedback	18	3	No radicals should be formed in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	18	4	Your mechanism is missing the first intermediate.  You need to protonate the correct atom.  Protonation converts the neighboring atom to a better electrophile.  Which atom needs to be more electrophilic so that a nucleophile can make a bond to it?
evalFeedback	18	6	2-Hydroxycyclopentanone (or its protonated form) is not an intermediate.  Reorder your steps so that the MeO-C bond forms before the ring expands.
evalFeedback	18	7	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	18	8	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 12.
evalFeedback	18	9	Under acidic conditions, what is the mechanism of elimination?
evalFeedback	18	10	The cleavage of the final O-H bond occurs in a separate step from the 1,2-shift.
evalFeedback	18	11	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	18	12	Don't draw four-membered transition states for H^+ transfer.
evalFeedback	18	13	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	18	14	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	18	15	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	18	16	Good! The carbonyl O is protonated and CH3OH adds.  After proton transfer, H2O leaves.  Ring expansion occurs to give a new cation, which loses H^+ to give the product.
qStmt	19		Design a synthesis of the compound in Figure 1.  All its C atoms should derive from <i><b>benzene</b></i> or from starting materials (other than those in the reagents menu) containing <i><b>no more than three contiguous C atoms</b></i>.
evalFeedback	19	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	19	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	19	5	Good!  The most straightforward disconnection begins with the ether, which can be made from CH3CH2CH2Br and the benzylic alcohol.  The alcohol can be made from the corresponding ketone, which can be made by bromination of the acylbenzene, which can be made by a Friedel-Crafts reaction.  Another approach would be to combine CH3CH2CH2OH with a benzylic bromide, which could be made from the corresponding alcohol with PBr3 or from the alkane by free-radical bromination.
qStmt	20		Design a synthesis of the compound in Figure 1.  All its C atoms should derive from starting materials (other than those in the reagents menu) containing <i><b>no more than three C atoms</b></i>.
evalFeedback	20	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.

evalFeedback	1	14	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	1	15	Good! A base-catalyzed aldol reaction occurs, followed by base-catalyzed elimination of H2O, followed by an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction.
qStmt	2		<b>3b</b>.  Draw a reasonable mechanism for the reaction in the Figure.
evalFeedback	2	1	Your mechanism must lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your mechanism should use all three indicated starting materials.
evalFeedback	2	3	No radicals should be formed in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	2	4	Your mechanism is missing the first intermediate.  You need to protonate the correct atom.  Protonation converts the neighboring atom to a better electrophile.  Which atom needs to be more electrophilic so that a nucleophile can make a bond to it?
evalFeedback	2	6	2-Hydroxycyclopentanone (or its protonated form) is not an intermediate.  Reorder your steps so that the MeO-C bond forms before the ring expands.
evalFeedback	2	7	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	2	8	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 12.

evalFeedback	2	16	Good! The carbonyl O is protonated and CH3OH adds.  After proton transfer, H2O leaves.  Ring expansion occurs to give a new cation, which loses H^+ to give the product.
qStmt	3		Design a synthesis of the compound in the Figure from neutral, metal-free starting materials containing no more than <i><b>four contiguous</b></i> C atoms, plus any reagents chosen from the reaction conditions menu.  Ideally, your synthesis would require between three and seven steps.
evalFeedback	3	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	3	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	3	5	Good!  The diketone indicates a Dieckmann reaction.  Disconnecting with H2C-C(=O) bond gives a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound, which can be made by a Michael reaction, which requires a 1,3-dicarbonyl nucleophile, so add a CO2Et group to the C adjacent to the iPr group.  Introduce the iPr group with an alkylation of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound.
qStmt	4		<b>4b</b>.  Design a synthesis of the compound in the Figure from neutral, metal-free starting materials containing no more than <i><b>four contiguous</b></i> C atoms, plus any reagents chosen from the reaction conditions menu.  Ideally, your synthesis would require five to seven steps.

qStmt	5		<b>2a</b>.  Explain why indene is twenty orders of magnitude more acidic than indane.
evalFeedback	5	1	Deprotonation of indene gives a compound whose five-membered ring is aromatic, and deprotonation of indane does not, so the deprotonation of indene is much less unfavorable thermodynamically than deprotonation of indane.
qStmt	6		<b>2b</b>.  Explain why the reaction in the Figure is selective for the product shown, and the other regioisomer is not obtained at all.
evalFeedback	6	1	This addition proceeds by a free-radical mechanism.  The product-determining step is addition of Br&#183; to the alkene.  The Br&#183; prefers to add to the C atom that gives the lower energy radical.  In this case, the lower energy radical is the one where it resides on the benzylic C atom, putting the Br atom on the homobenzylic C atom.
qStmt	7		<b>2c</b>.  Explain why the reaction in the Figure does not work as written, and suggest how you can modify the reagents or the reaction conditions to obtain the product shown.
evalFeedback	7	1	The simple enolate is more basic than nucleophilic toward 2&#176; alkyl halides, so elimination will occur.  Start with the diester and do a Krapcho decarboxylation after the alkylation to get the desired product.

(You may find it convenient to draw the skeleton, then choose Edit &rarr; Add &rarr; Explicit H Atoms.)

evalFeedback	1	7	What intermediate is obtained after the C-C bond forms?
evalFeedback	1	8	You have drawn a mechanism with a linear topology. This mechanism involves radicals, so it is much more likely to proceed by a chain mechanism. In a chain mechanism, the boxes must be connected by arrows in a circle, although there may be a short linear sequence of boxes that leads to one box in the circle.

evalFeedback	8	4	Good!
qStmt	9		When the compound in the figure is treated with H2 and Pd/C, its color changes from yellow to nearly colorless.  Why?
evalFeedback	9	1	Because the alkenes are hydrogenated to single bonds, so the compound is no longer nearly as conjugated, so the HOMO-LUMO gap increases.
qStmt	10		The compound is much less aromatic than one would expect.  Why?  Hint: Obey Grossman's rule, and think about what is required for a compound to be aromatic.
evalFeedback	10	1	Because the C-H bonds on the two middle C atoms bang into one another, so the compound is not planar, so there is much less overlap between adjacent C=C bonds than one might expect from the picture.
qStmt	11		Is the compound in the figure aromatic, antiaromatic, or nonaromatic?  Explain your answer, including how you treat the triple bond.
evalFeedback	11	1	Antiaromatic.  Only one of the #pi bonds of the triple bond overlaps with the other #pi bonds, so there are an even number of electron pairs in the continuously overlapping cyclic array of p orbitals.
qStmt	12		Which diene in the figure undergoes Diels-Alder reactions faster, and why?
evalFeedback	12	1	The second one.  The first one has trouble maintaining the planar <i>s</i>-cis conformation due to steric hindrance between the two CH3 groups.
qStmt	13		Undergraduate research assistants Sally Humdinger and Will Wurklanghauers are discussing the two compounds in the figures.  Sally thinks that the bicyclic compound will autoxidize more quickly because it can form a more substituted radical.  Will disagrees.  Who is right, and why?  If you wish, you can click on the picture of the structure and rotate it in 3D.
evalFeedback	13	1	Will is right.  The bicyclic compound produces a radical that is not stabilized by the O atom because its single filled orbital cannot overlap with the O atom's filled orbitals.

evalFeedback	5	7	No atom in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	5	9	Two compounds that are both negatively charged or contain ionic bonds to metals should not react with one another.  One of them should undergo a reaction that makes it neutral before it reacts with the other.
evalFeedback	5	10	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What happens after the first new C-H bond is formed?
evalFeedback	5	11	The C-O bond forms in the very last step of the mechanism, after the AlH4^- has finished doing its job.
evalFeedback	5	12	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.

qStmt	7		Design a synthesis of the given compound from benzene or toluene and/or from any other starting materials containing no more than a total of six C atoms.  (You may use any reagents from the reagents menu.)
evalFeedback	7	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	7	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	7	5	Good!
qStmt	8		Design a synthesis of the given compound from benzene and any other neutral, metal-free starting materials containing no more than a total of four C atoms.  (You may use any reagents from the reagents menu.)
evalFeedback	8	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	8	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	8	5	Good!
qStmt	9		Explain <i>both</i> why the following reaction <i>fails</i> as written and why it <i>succeeds</i> in the presence of a Pd-phosphine catalyst.
evalFeedback	9	1	It fails because it can undergo neither SN2 (requires backside attack) nor S<sub>N</sub>Ar (requires anion-stabilizing groups) are possible.  A Pd-phosphine catalyst allows the reaction to proceed by inserting into the C-Br bond, doing substitution at Pd, then pulling out and allowing the bond between the nucleophile and C to form.
qStmt	10		An exchange student from Israel, Chava Guttheim, joins Sally Humdinger in the laboratory for the summer.  Chava proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Sally is skeptical that it will work as written.  Explain why Sally thinks the reaction won't work, and suggest a reaction sequence that will circumvent Sally's objections.  (Your proposed sequence may require more than one step.  It <i>must</i> begin with the same starting material and end with the same target.)
evalFeedback	10	1	The reaction won't work because the NH2 is a good base, and AlCl3 is a strong Lewis acid, and when they form a Lewis acid-base complex, the N becomes a strong deactivator.<p>To solve the problem, acetylate the N before carrying out the Friedel-Crafts reaction, and hydrolyze the amide afterwards with aq. NaOH.
qStmt	11		Which compound will react more quickly with EtO^-, and why?  (No credit without an acceptable explanation.)
evalFeedback	11	1	The first compound will react more quickly because the anionic intermediate has a resonance structure in which the negative charge is on the N, and the intermediate derived from the reaction of the second compound does not.
qStmt	12		Why are thioesters intermediate in reactivity between acyl chlorides and esters?
evalFeedback	12	1	Because S is less electronegative than Cl, it is less destabilizing of the C(+)-O(-) resonance structure.  Because O is smaller and closer in size to C, it is a much better resonance donor than S, so it is much more stabilizing of the C(+)-O(-) resonance structure.
qStmt	13		Rank the following compounds from most reactive (rank 1) toward nucleophiles to least reactive.
qdText	13	1	methoxyacetaldehyde
qdText	13	2	acetaldehyde

qStmt	14		An exchange student from Israel, Chava Guttheim, joins Sally Humdinger in the laboratory for the summer.  Chava proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Sally is skeptical that it will work as written.  Explain why Sally thinks the reaction won't work, and suggest a reaction sequence that will circumvent Sally's objections.  (Your proposed sequence may require more than one step.  It <i>must</i> begin with the same starting material and end with the same target.)
evalFeedback	14	1	The CH3Li will add twice to the ester.  To solve the problem, convert the ester to a Weinreb amide, or convert it to an aldehyde, and then oxidize the resulting 2&#176; alcohol.

qStmt	9		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger needs to make the dipeptide shown.  She suggests to her labmate, Lulu Yomama, that she can use DCC to couple the two amino acids shown.  Lulu doubts that the reaction will work as written.  Give <b><i>two</i></b> of Lulu's concerns.
qStmt	10		Sally, being a strong-willed Humdinger, decides to go ahead and try the reaction anyway.  She finds alanine, the starting material on the left, in the laboratory reagent cabinet, but not cyclohexylglycine, the starting material on the right.  She tells Lulu that she will make cyclohexylglycine from cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (C6H11CHO), NH4Cl, and NaCN.  Lulu agrees that this route to cyclohexylglycine will work, but she warns Sally that even if the coupling reaction works as written, Sally will obtain two products, not one, from the coupling of her synthetic cyclohexylglycine with alanine. Why?
qStmt	11		Why does the following reaction work under acidic conditions, but not under basic conditions?
evalFeedback	11	1	Under both acidic and basic conditions, a hemiacetal forms.  For the acetal to form from the hemiacetal, a substitution of OH must occur.  Under acidic conditions, this can occur by the SN1 mechanism.  Under basic conditions, OH is a terrible leaving group, and the C at which substitution is occurring is hindered, so no substitution takes place.
qStmt	12		Usually, when primary amines react with a ketone, an imine forms preferentially over an enamine.  However, when the ketone is #b to another carbonyl group, as in 1,3-cyclohexanedione, the opposite is true.  Why?
evalFeedback	12	1	Because the enamine allows the N lone pair to participate in resonance with the remaining ketone, greatly lowering its energy.

evalFeedback	7	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	7	3	Deprotonation of CH3 groups adjacent to carbonyls with LDA generally doesn't work well because the carbonyl group, being fairly unhindered, is quite prone to act as an electrophile toward the enolate that you are generating.

qStmt	13		Explain why the following reaction does not proceed as written.
evalFeedback	13	1	Because for a Claisen or Dieckmann reaction to proceed, it must be possible to deprotonate the product between the two carbonyl C atoms.  It's not possible here.
qStmt	14		Explain why the following reaction does not proceed as written.
evalFeedback	14	1	Because the product is a very acidic 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, it consumes base as the reaction proceeds, so a full equivalent of base is needed to promote the reaction.

qStmt	16		Give two reasons why the following reaction does not work well, and suggest another way that the product might be obtained.
evalFeedback	16	1	Both ketones are equally nucleophilic and electrophilic, so a mixture of four products is likely to be obtained.  Also, under catalytic basic conditions, dehydration is likely to occur.  Obtain this product using the LDA method to deprotonate the cyclic ketone, then add the acyclic one.

evalFeedback	2	9	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	2	10	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 5.
evalFeedback	2	11	Primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond, as well as the CH3^+ ion, are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.
evalFeedback	2	12	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	2	13	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.

qStmt	11		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the elimination step won't be selective for the desired diastereomer under <i>either</i> acidic <i>or</i> basic conditions.  Explain Sally's reasoning for <i>acidic</i> conditions.
evalFeedback	11	1	Zaitsev's rule always applies under acidic conditions, so Jess will predominantly obtain the lower energy diastereomer, but she wants the higher energy diastereomer.
qStmt	12		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the elimination step won't be selective for the desired diastereomer under <i>either</i> acidic <i>or</i> basic conditions.  Explain Sally's reasoning for <i>basic</i> conditions.  (The answer is <i>not</i> the same as the answer under acidic conditions.)
evalFeedback	12	1	Zaitsev's rule does not apply under basic conditions when the two C atoms involved in making the new &#960; bond are both stereogenic, as in this case.  Instead, the relative configuration of the two C atoms determines which diastereomer of the alkene predominates in the elimination reaction.  In this case, the Grignard reagent would not have added stereospecifically to the aldehyde, so Jess would have a mixture of diastereomeric alcohols, so she will get a mixture of diastereomeric alkenes in exactly the same ratio.
qStmt	13		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans the synthesis shown in Figure 1. Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the plan and tells Jess that the desired product won't be the major product. Why is Sally so critical?
evalFeedback	13	1	Under acidic conditions, elimination occurs at 3&#176; alcohols when there is a low concentration of nucleophile, but substitution occurs when there is a high concentration of nucleophile.  In this case, the 1&#176; alcohol has a high local concentration because it is tethered to the 3&#176; alcohol, so it swings around to make a 6-membered ring.
qStmt	14		Explain why the substitution in Figure 1 proceeds with <b>retention</b> of configuration, even though the substitution in Figure 2 proceeds with <b>inversion</b> of configuration.  (The reaction conditions are exactly the same in both cases.)
evalFeedback	14	1	Retention of configuration = two inversions.  Inversion occurs when the azide attacks the tosylate, as in the second reaction.  The first reaction must have some other nucleophile reacting with the tosylate first, then the azide displaces the first nucleophile to give an overall retention.  What other nucleophile is present in the reaction that can react very quickly with the tosylate?  The amine!

evalFeedback	6	10	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What is the mechanism by which H2O is eliminated from aldols?
evalFeedback	6	11	It is bad practice to draw a four-membered transition state for proton transfer.  Protonate the O and deprotonate the C in two separate steps.
evalFeedback	6	12	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	6	13	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	6	14	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.

evalFeedback	8	5	We don't use alkylation reactions to make 1,5-dicarbonyl compounds.
evalFeedback	8	6	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.

evalFeedback	9	3	Your synthesis is not enantioselective.
evalFeedback	9	4	It's not a good idea to use an alkyl halide as an electrophile in an SN2 reaction that needs to be enantioselective, because the halide leaving group can act as a nucleophile toward unreacted starting material and scramble its configuration before the desired nucleophile has a chance to react with it.

qStmt	10		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that it is unlikely to work well.  What does Sally explain is likely to happen instead?
evalFeedback	10	1	As the reaction proceeds, the base will not distinguish between starting material and monoalkylated product, so a mixture of mono- and polyalkylated compounds (as well as starting material) will be obtained.
qStmt	11		When the diketo ester shown on the left is treated with catalytic base, the bridged bicyclic ketone on the right is obtained quickly.  However, as the reaction proceeds, the bridged bicyclic ketone reverts back to starting material, and a different product that is not a bridged bicyclic ketone (i.e., has a different C skeleton from the bridged bicyclic ketone) forms in its place.  Why does the initial product revert back to starting material?  (The 3D structure of the bridged bicyclic ketone is provided in Figure 2.)
evalFeedback	11	1	Dehydration of this #b-hydroxyketone to give an #a,#b-unsaturated ketone cannot occur because the bridgehead C cannot assume sp2 hybridization.  The driving force for an aldol reaction under catalytic conditions is dehydration.  Dehydration of this #b-hydroxyketone to give an #a,#b-unsaturated ketone cannot occur because the bridgehead C cannot assume sp2 hybridization, so a retroaldol reaction occurs.
qStmt	12		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that it is unlikely to work.  What does Sally explain is likely to happen instead?
evalFeedback	12	1	Diethyl malonate is very acidic, and Grignard reagents are very strong bases.  The Grignard reagent will simply deprotonate the C between the two carbonyls.  Once the enolate is formed, neither carbonyl is very electrophilic, so no further reaction occurs.  Upon workup, the enolate is reprotonated and the starting material retrieved unchanged.
qStmt	13		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that it is unlikely to work.  What does Sally explain is likely to happen instead?
evalFeedback	13	1	Aldehydes are very reactive.  As the LDA begins to the aldehyde, the resulting enolate will react with more aldehyde in the reaction mixture, giving a mess even before Jess has a chance to add the CH3I.

evalFeedback	6	4	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.

evalFeedback	6	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate. Count how many nucleophiles are in this compound (3-(piperidin-2-ylmethyl)phenol)  and find the best among them.   


  What is the purpose of H^+?  With what atom in the electrophile will it react to make it more electrophilic?
evalFeedback	6	8	Because acid (H^+) is present, no bases in this mechanism should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 13.
evalFeedback	6	9	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	6	10	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a &#960; bond, or a &#963; bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a &#963; bond to H. In other words, don't use the electrons in a C-H or N&#8211;H bond to make a new bond from C or N to another atom.
evalFeedback	6	11	The O atom needs to be protonated in a separate step before the C-O bond breaks.
evalFeedback	6	12	You have drawn an elimination proceeding by an E2 mechanism.  What is the mechanism by which eliminations occur under acidic conditions?
evalFeedback	6	13	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	6	14	It is considered bad practice to draw a four-centered transition state for a proton transfer reaction.  Protonate the O with a separate H^+ while the N-H bond cleaves.
evalFeedback	6	15	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.  You can achieve the same result with fewer electron-flow arrows.
evalFeedback	6	16	Your mechanism is mostly correct, but boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.

evalFeedback	7	11	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 18.
evalFeedback	7	12	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	7	13	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	7	14	It's bad practice to draw a four-membered transition state for proton transfer.  Deprotonate one N, then protonate the other in a separate step.

evalFeedback	2	11	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa &gt; 5.

qStmt	10		Undergraduate research assistants Sally Humdinger and Will Wurklanghauers are discussing the following addition reaction.  Sally, following Markovnikov's rule, says that the MeO group will add to the C(sp2) atom on the right because it is more substituted.  Will disagrees.  Who is right, and why?

evalFeedback	12	1	D is the major product from addition to the more electron-rich #pi bond, anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry, and syn stereochemistry (which gives the trans product).
qStmt	13		Unsaturated fatty acids such as those found in olive oil are quicker to spoil when exposed to air than saturated fatty acids such as those found in margarine.  Why?
evalFeedback	13	1	Spoilage is often caused by reaction with air.  The allylic C-H bonds that are present only in unsaturated fats are more likely to react with air because they give lower-energy radicals upon H&#183; abstraction.

evalFeedback	14	1	Good!
evalFeedback	14	2	Close, but the one peak integrating to 3H is a singlet at 2.2 ppm.
evalFeedback	14	3	Close, but there's only one resonance integrating to 3H (the singlet), and no resonance is integrating to 1H.
evalFeedback	14	4	Close, but there's only one resonance integrating to 3H (the singlet), and no resonance is integrating to 1H, and your structure does not account for the singlet.

qStmt	15		All dienes contain within themselves a dienophile, yet most dienes do not undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with themselves to give a dimer.  (See the example in the Figure.)  Why not?
evalFeedback	15	1	The diene and dienophile must be electronically complementary, one electron-rich and the other electron-poor, for the Diels-Alder reaction to go at a reasonable rate.  Such is not the case when dienes dimerize.
qStmt	16		One exception to the general observation that dienes do not undergo Diels-Alder reactions with themselves is cyclopentadiene.  It undergoes dimerization within hours at room temperature.  Why is cyclopentadiene so much more prone to undergo dimerization than other dienes are?
evalFeedback	16	1	Cyclopentadiene is locked in the s-cis conformation, greatly reducing its barrier to Diels-Alder reactions.
qStmt	17		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger has made vinyl trifluoroacetate (see the Figure) and taken its ^1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum.  She was expecting to see four singlets, one for each of the C atoms in the compound, but she saw two singlets and two quartets.  Explain to Sally why she sees two quartets and two singlets.
evalFeedback	17	1	F is a magnetically active nucleus, with a spin of 1/2.  In the proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum, the F atoms are not decoupled, so they couple to the nearby C atoms.  In this case, the C atoms of the CF3 and C=O groups are split into quartets by the three F atoms.  The C atoms of the alkene are further away, so they do not couple with the F atoms and remain singlets.

evalFeedback	2	18	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	2	19	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state.  Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.
evalFeedback	2	20	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.

qStmt	4		Draw the major (uncharged) product of the reaction after aqueous workup.  Look carefully at the reagent.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	Look more carefully at the reagent.
evalFeedback	4	3	The enamine is unfavored relative to what other product?

qStmt	7		Aryl chlorides react more slowly than aryl bromides in the Suzuki reaction.  Which step of the catalytic cycle for the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling is most likely responsible for the difference in rates, and why is this step slower for aryl chlorides than it is for aryl bromides?
evalFeedback	7	1	In the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, Pd has to insert into the C-Cl or C-Br bond.  Br is larger than Cl, so the C-Cl bond is stronger (shorter, better overlap between orbitals) than the C-Br bond, hence it is harder to break.
qStmt	8		Explain why EtO^- substitutes the Cl atom para to the NO2 group and not the Cl atom meta to the NO2 group.
evalFeedback	8	1	In this nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, EtO^- can add to either C bearing a Cl atom, but addition to the one para to the NO2 group gives a carbanion that is stabilized by resonance with the NO2 group, whereas addition to the one meta to the NO2 group does not.
qStmt	9		Why is it much easier to form an acetal from 1,2-ethanediol than from methanol?
evalFeedback	9	1	In the mechanism of formation of an acetal from a hemiacetal, the last step (except for a deprotonation) is addition of a second alcohol to a carbocation.  In the case of 1,2-ethanediol, this step is intramolecular and forms a five-membered ring, so it is much faster than in the case of methanol.
qStmt	10		Alkenes generally behave as nucleophiles, but the triene shown in the Figure is electrophilic, as illustrated by its rapid reaction with the strong nucleophile CH3MgBr.  Why does the triene react readily with nucleophiles such as CH3MgBr?
evalFeedback	10	1	When the Grignard reagent adds to the CH2 group, the electrons in the CH2=C #pi bond move to the ring C, giving an aromatic intermediate from a nonaromatic precursor.  As a result, this step is very favorable energetically.  You could also say the the CH2=C bond is already very polarized to put both electrons on the ring C (to make the ring aromatic), leaving the CH2 group with a partial + charge, making it very electrophilic.
qStmt	11		Design a synthesis of the target compound from <b>benzene</b> and any other compounds containing <b>three or fewer contiguous C atoms</b>.  You may also use any compounds at all from the reagents menu.

evalFeedback	12	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	12	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	12	4	Good!
qStmt	13		In class, we discussed two syntheses of methamphetamine: reduction of pseudoephedrine with Li in liquid NH3, and reduction of the iminium ion derived from phenylacetone and methylamine.  One of these methods produces methamphetamine with twice the potency of the other.  Which, and why?
evalFeedback	13	1	The second method uses achiral starting materials to give a chiral product.  Optically inactive starting materials always give optically inactive products, so the product must be racemic.  Only one of the two enantiomers produced by the second method will have the desired physiological effect.  The first method uses a starting material that already has the stereocenter of the product set in the correct configuration.

evalFeedback	8	2	Good!
qStmt	9		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger has made the five synthetic intermediates shown in Figure 1 and taken their IR spectra, but she neglected to label the spectra, so she doesn't know which spectra belong to which compounds.

qStmt	10		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger decided to carry out the elimination reaction in Figure 1.  When she isolated the major product and took its MS spectrum, she was gratified to find that the product had the expected mass of 96 amu.  However, when she took its ^1H NMR spectrum (Figure 2), she was surprised to find that the product displayed no resonances downfield of 4.5 ppm.  Propose a structure for Sally&#8217;s product.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!
evalFeedback	10	2	No, this compound is what she was expecting, and it doesn't match the 1H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	10	3	You can only draw one compound.
evalFeedback	10	4	Your response doesn't have a molecular weight of 96 amu.
evalFeedback	10	5	Your response can contain only C, H, and O.

evalFeedback	10	7	Your response has the right molecular weight and an appropriate formula, but it would have resonances downfield of 2.5 ppm.
evalFeedback	10	8	Your response has the right molecular weight and an appropriate formula, and it would not have any resonance downfield of 2.5 ppm, but its NMR spectrum would not match the one shown.
qStmt	11		Explain the observation in one or two grammatically correct English sentences.  Simply rewording the statement will not earn you any points; I want a physical or chemical explanation of the observation.  <p>The aromatic H atoms <i>para</i> to the carbonyl group in acetophenone resonate further downfield than do the <i>meta</i> H atoms.
evalFeedback	11	1	You can draw a good resonance structure that puts a negative charge on O and a positive charge on the para C atom (but not the meta C atom), so the para C atom is deshielded compared to the meta C atom, pulling its chemical shift downfield.
qStmt	12		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger carried out the reaction shown.  She obtained one major product and one minor product, which had MS, IR, and NMR spectra consistent with the trans and cis isomers shown.  

<p>The <b>major</b> product showed the following nonaromatic resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum: 
 <table class="dbTable">

</table>

<p>Tell Sally whether the <b>major</b> product of her reaction is the cis or trans isomer, and tell her how the 1H NMR spectra reveal the answer.
evalFeedback	12	1	The H-C=C-H coupling constant in the major isomer is 11.6 Hz, whereas it is 15.9 Hz in the minor isomer.  Cis alkene coupling constants are always smaller than trans alkene coupling constants, so the major product is cis.
qStmt	13		Explain the observation in one or two grammatically correct English sentences.  Simply rewording the statement will not earn you any points; I want a physical or chemical explanation of the observation.  <p>The osteoporosis drug Fosamax (shown in its acidic form) displays only triplets in the proton-coupled 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	13	1	Three of the C atoms are split into triplets by the two attached H atoms.  The fourth C atom is split into a triplet by the two attached P atoms, which also have a spin of 1/2, just like H.
qStmt	14		Explain the observation in one or two grammatically correct English sentences.  Simply rewording the statement will not earn you any points; I want a physical or chemical explanation of the observation.  <p>The indicated H atom in the compound shown in Figure 1 resonates at 10.34 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, far downfield of where the other aromatic H atoms in this compound resonate.
evalFeedback	14	1	The torus of electron density of the alkyne creates a deshielding region outside of it, and the indicated H atom lies deep in this deshielding region.

evalFeedback	6	1	Your mechanism should lead to the given product.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please use the starting material provided.
evalFeedback	6	3	What is the role of the air?
evalFeedback	6	4	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  Identify carefully which bonds are made and broken in this reaction.  What is the role of O2?
evalFeedback	6	5	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What compound will be obtained after the new O-C bond is formed?
evalFeedback	6	7	You have drawn a mechanism with a linear topology. This reaction requires air, so what kind of intermediates is it likely to involve, and what is the topology likely to be?
evalFeedback	6	8	O2 is an initiator in this reaction, so &#183;OOH should not be involved in the propagation part of the mechanism.
evalFeedback	6	9	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	6	10	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	6	11	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	6	12	Good!
qStmt	7		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the reaction shown.  Draw in the H atoms, and focus on the &sigma; bonds that need to be made and the &sigma; bonds that need to be broken.

evalFeedback	7	2	Please draw both starting materials correctly.
evalFeedback	7	3	No radicals should form in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	7	4	What would be the first step for AlCl3?
evalFeedback	7	6	When an aromatic C atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a #pi bond to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.
evalFeedback	7	7	No atom in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	7	8	Dyotropic rearrangements, in which atoms or groups attached to neighboring atoms switch places in a single, concerted step, are extremely unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	7	9	SN2 substitution does not occur at an sp- or sp2-hybridized atom.
evalFeedback	7	10	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	7	11	Elimination reactions do not occur by the E2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	7	12	Don't generate strong bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	7	13	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	7	14	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	7	15	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	7	16	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 10.  But I'll give you credit anyway.
evalFeedback	7	17	Good!
qStmt	8		Give <b>two</b> reasons why compound <b>A</b>, unlike many dienes, doesn't require heating to undergo a Diels-Alder reaction.
evalFeedback	8	1	(1) Because the dienophile is locked in the s-cis conformation.  (2) Because the starting materials are nonaromatic, and the product is aromatic, there is a large driving force for the reaction, and this driving force is reflected in the transition state.
qStmt	9		The compound in the figure is a widely used medicinal drug.  When it reaches the liver, an enzyme abstracts H&#8226; from it.  From which atom is H&#8226; most likely to be abstracted, and why that atom?
evalFeedback	9	1	The H atom is abstracted from the position where the resulting radical is most stabilized.  N is the best stabilizer of an adjacent radical, so the best answer is from one of the CH2 groups adjacent to the N atom, but a reasonable case can also be made for abstracting it from the benzylic CH that also bears the OH group.
qStmt	10		Explain why compound <b>A</b> undergoes substitution with Br2 at the "meta" position.  NOTE: Merely stating that N is a meta director will get you no credit.  Refer to specific compounds or intermediates in your response.
evalFeedback	10	1	When the Br atom attacks meta, the intermediate is electron-deficient at the ortho and para C atoms.  When the Br atom attacks ortho or para, the intermediate is electron-deficient at the meta C atoms and the N.  Because N is more electronegative than C, the latter intermediate is higher in energy than the former, so only meta attack occurs.  Note: The lone pairs on the N cannot stabilize an ortho carbocation, because to do so would make the N sp-hybridized, which would require 180&#176; bond angles, which is not possible in a cyclic compound.
qStmt	11		Every organic chemistry textbook states that the mechanism for Friedel-Crafts acylation is the one shown in the Figure, but this mechanism is almost certainly <i>wrong</i>.  Which step in the mechanism is exceedingly unlikely, and what happens instead?
evalFeedback	11	1	The first step of the mechanism is wrong, because Al would much rather make a bond to O.  One can draw favorable resonance structures for CH3C(Cl)C=O^+&#8211;^-AlCl3, but one can't for CH3C(=O)CCl^+&#8211;^-AlCl3.  After Al coordinates to O, benzene makes a bond to the carbonyl C atom, pushing a pair of #pi electrons up onto the O.  That pair of electrons can come back down, kicking out the Cl atom, to reestablish the C=O #pi bond.
qStmt	12		Design a synthesis of the given compound from benzene, toluene, or any other starting material with four or fewer contiguous C atoms.  NOTE: The CN group has the same effect on the ability of an aromatic ring to do Friedel-Crafts reactions as does the NO2 group.

evalFeedback	6	9	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	6	10	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	6	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	6	12	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	13	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.

evalFeedback	6	15	Two nucleophiles in the reaction mixture make bonds to the carbonyl C; which would do so more quickly?
evalFeedback	6	16	Elimination reactions do not occur by the E2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	6	17	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state.  Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.
evalFeedback	6	18	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.

qStmt	10		The equilibrium between an imine and an enamine usually favors the imine, but the following equilibrium is an exception.  Why?
evalFeedback	10	1	The enamine is conjugated to the benzene ring, which lowers its energy.  Another way of putting it is that the position of the C=C bond allows the N lone pair to be delocalized into the aromatic ring by resonance.
qStmt	11		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger decides to carry out the synthesis in the Figure.  When she adds the Grignard reagent to the carbonyl compound, she sees a vigorous reaction, but when she completes her aqueous work-up, she finds that she obtains only the starting carbonyl compound and none of the expected alcohol.  Explain to Sally why the reaction did not go as she expected and what happened instead.
evalFeedback	11	1	Carboxylic acids are good acids, and Grignard reagents are good bases, so all that happened is that the Grignard reagent deprotonated the carboxylic acid to give a carboxylate, which was inert to further reaction.  Upon workup, the carboxylate was reprotonated to give back the carboxylic acid.
qStmt	12		In <b>basic</b> water, the #a-anomer of glucose (left) is in equilibrium with the #b-anomer (right).  Explain how the inversion of configuration takes place.
evalFeedback	12	1	The hemiacetals are in equilibrium under basic conditions with acyclic alcohol-aldehydes.  The acyclic aldehyde can rotate about the C-C bond, so that when the ring closes again, the O can be oriented in either the axial or the equatorial position.  Note: Neither an SN1 mechanism (requires acidic conditions) nor an SN2 mechanism (HO^- is a terrible leaving group) is a satisfactory explanation.
qStmt	13		Although ketones rapidly react with 1,2-diols under acidic conditions to form acetals, esters do not.  Propose an explanation for this observation.
evalFeedback	13	1	Esters are lower in energy than ketones, and the equilibrium constant for acetal formation is so unfavorable for esters that the reaction is not observed.  If any reaction occurs at all, it will be a transesterification reaction (MeO replaced with HOCH2CH2O).

qStmt	11		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans to carry out the reaction shown.  Graduate student Sally Humdinger looks at the planned reaction, tells Jess that it won't work, and then leaves the room.  Jess wants to know why her planned reaction won't work.  Explain to Jess why the reaction won't work as written.  (It is insufficient to tell her that the reaction would work if she did it a different way.  She wants to know why it won't work as written.)
evalFeedback	11	1	<p>In a Dieckmann reaction, the product is a #b-keto ester, which is very acidic, so as the product is formed, it consumes base.  If Jess uses only a catalytic amount of base, all the base will be consumed after just a little bit of starting material has reacted, and so the great majority of the starting material will not react at all.  </p>
qStmt	12		Jess carries out the first reaction, and it works great.  She then tries to carry out the second reaction, and it doesn't work at all -- she gets dimerizations from aldehydes reacting with aldehydes, but the ester doesn't react at all.  Explain why the ester-aldehyde doesn't cyclize like the dialdehyde does.
evalFeedback	12	1	<p>Esters are lower in energy than aldehydes, so they are less prone to form enols, the nucleophilic species under acidic conditions.
qStmt	13		When 6-bromo-1-hexene is treated with Bu3SnH in the presence of air, <i>only</i> cyclic product is obtained.  By contrast, when 5-bromopentanal is treated with Bu3SnH in the presence of air, <i>no</i> cyclic product is obtained.  Explain why the aldehyde does not undergo cyclization whereas the alkene does.
evalFeedback	13	1	<p>The air indicates that these reactions involve radicals.  Both reactions start with Bu3Sn&#183; abstracting Br atom from starting material to give a C&#183; radical.  In the first case, this radical cyclizes to give a new C&#183; radical.  In the second case, cyclization would give an O&#183; radical.  Because O is electronegative, it hates to be electron-deficient, so cyclization does not occur.</p>

qStmt	10		The equilibrium for the reaction of primary amines with ketones to give imines and H2O usually lies on the side of the ketones.  However, in the case of pyruvic acid (shown), the equilibrium lies on the side of the imine.  Why?
evalFeedback	10	1	The ketone in pyruvic acid is higher in energy than your average ketone because the CO2H group is electron-withdrawing, destabilizing the C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure.  A higher-energy ketone pushes the equilibrium to the right.

However, compound <b>3</b> is much <b>higher</b> in energy than compound <b>4</b>.  Why does the N atom in compound <b>3</b> fail to stabilize the radical?
evalFeedback	11	1	In compound 1, the N stabilizes the C radical because the N orbital containing the lone pair and the C orbital containing the lone electron can overlap, leading to two electrons going down in energy and one going up in energy.  In compound 3, the two orbitals do not overlap (one is perpendicular to the plane of the screen, the other is vertical in the plane of the screen) and are prevented from doing so by the compound's geometry, so the N atom's electronegativity dominates its effect on the radical, leading to its destabilization.
qStmt	12		Hemiacetals can be converted to acetals under acidic conditions, but not under basic conditions.  Why not?
evalFeedback	12	1	The conversion of a hemiacetal to an acetal is a substitution reaction at C(sp3).  Under basic conditions, substitution at C(sp3) must occur by the SN2 mechanism.  HO^- is a lousy leaving group in SN2 substitutions, and the central C is fairly hindered in hemiacetals, so substitution under basic conditions is extremely slow.  Under acidic conditions, substitution at C(sp3) usually occurs by the SN1 mechanism.  Under acidic conditions, the OH can be protonated to give a much better leaving group, and, when it leaves, a highly stabilized carbocation is generated.
qStmt	13		Nucleophilic substitution of halide occurs readily on halopyridines, but not on halopyrroles.  Explain.
evalFeedback	13	1	Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs by an addition-elimination mechanism.  When a nucleophile adds to the C in 2-chloropyridine that bears the Cl atom, a pair of &#960; electrons can move onto the somewhat electronegative N atom, stabilizing the nonaromatic intermediate.  The N atom in N-methyl-2-chloropyrrole can't accept a pair of &#960; electrons, so the nonaromatic intermediate is unstabilized and too high in energy to be reached.

evalFeedback	1	1	Your mechanism doesn't lead to the indicated product.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please use both given starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	3	No radicals should form in this polar mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	4	No carbocations (except iminium ions) should be generated under basic reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	1	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  Which happens first, the cleavage of the O-containing ring or the making of the all-carbon ring?
evalFeedback	1	7	No acids in this mechanism that takes place under basic conditions should have pKa < 8.
evalFeedback	1	8	SN2 substitution does not occur at an sp- or sp2-hybridized atom.
evalFeedback	1	9	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

evalFeedback	2	6	The CH3^+ ion and primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.

evalFeedback	2	9	No bases in this mechanism that takes place under acidic conditions should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 8.
evalFeedback	2	10	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	2	11	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	2	12	Unstabilized primary carbocations are too high in energy to form.
evalFeedback	2	13	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	2	14	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state.  Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.
evalFeedback	2	15	Elimination reactions do not occur by the E2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	2	16	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.

evalFeedback	3	3	Good!
qStmt	4		Design a synthesis of the following compound from <b>toluene</b>.  (You will need to start from toluene twice, once for each side of the compound.)  You may also use any other starting materials containing <b>one</b> C atom or any reagents from the reaction conditions menu.
evalFeedback	4	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	Good!
qStmt	5		Undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov carries out the reaction shown in the figure.  She obtains a major product and a minor one.  Both products have MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectra that are consistent with the expected product, although the spectra of the two products differ from each other in small ways.  Assuming the major product is the expected one, explain to Jess what the minor product is and how it was produced.
evalFeedback	5	1	The minor product is a diastereomer of the major product, produced by epimerization of the #a-carbon of the carboxylic acid when it is converted into an acyl chloride.  Because acyl chlorides are very high in energy, they easily convert to their enols, which makes the #a-carbon planar; when they convert back to the carbonyl compound, the #a-carbon is equally likely to become R or S.
qStmt	6		On one of your homework assignments, you were asked to write a mechanism for the reaction shown.  The reaction requires two SN2 substitution reactions to occur: one with ^-CN as the nucleophile, and the other with an enolate as the nucleophile.  The best mechanism has the ^-CN substitution occurring first, and the enolate substitution occurring second.  Why is this order of events more likely than the opposite?  (You may want to use the word "whereas" in your response, as in, "If the enolate substitution occurs first, ..., whereas if the ^-CN substitution occurs first, ....")
evalFeedback	6	1	It is more likely that ^-CN reacts first, for several reasons.  One is that ^-CN is a pretty weak base, unlikely to deprotonate an #a-bromo ester.  If the ^-CN instead acts as a nucleophile, though, it produces an #a-cyano ester, which is very acidic, and can hence be deprotonated by more ^-CN and then do the substitution reaction.  Another reason is that if the ring closure occurs first, the remaining Br will be attached to a fully substituted C, at which SN2 substitution is unlikely to occur.  Another reason is that if ring closure occurs first, the two esters will likely be trans, and even if SN2 substitution by ^-CN could then occur (which it can't), the substitution would invert the configuration, making the esters cis, but they are trans in the observed product.
qStmt	7		Summer exchange student Chava Guttheim proposes to prepare 2-isopropylcyclopentanone from cyclopentanone and isopropyl iodide.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger advises Chava that the plan is unlikely to work as shown.  Why not, and what can Chava do to salvage her synthetic plan?
evalFeedback	7	1	Simple enolates plus 2&#176; alkyl halides give predominantly elimination, not substitution.  The solution is to use cyclopentanone with a CO2Et group on the #a-carbon in the substitution, and then do a Krapcho decarboxylation.
qStmt	8		An ester can be reduced with LiAlH4 at temperatures well below 0 &#176;C, but a carboxylic acid requires heating, even though carboxylic acids and esters are approximately the same in energy.  Explain.
evalFeedback	8	1	LiAlH4 is not only a terrific nucleophile, but also a pretty good base.  It deprotonates carboxylic acids to give carboxylates, which are resistant to further reaction.  Esters can't be deprotonated in the same way, so they are easy to reduce.
qStmt	9		Complete the sentence: Nucleophiles don't react with nucleophiles, no matter _____________, and no matter ____________.
evalFeedback	9	1	Nucleophiles don't react with nucleophiles, no matter how drunk they get, and no matter how long it's been since they reacted with something else.
qStmt	10		Draw the major product of the following reaction after aqueous workup.  Draw only a single, uncharged compound, or your response will be marked incorrect.  The reagents are: <ol><li>EtONa </li><li>PhCH2Br</li><li>aq. NaCl, DMSO, <i>&#916;</i></li></ol>

evalFeedback	7	12	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.

If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	8	16	Elimination of H2O from an aldol proceeds through a much lower energy carbocation than the one you have drawn.

qStmt	9		Explain why pyrrolidine (upper left) readily undergoes reductive amination, but pyrrole (lower left) does not.
evalFeedback	9	1	The mechanism requires that the N use its lone pair to form an iminium ion.  In the case of pyrrole, this reaction would disrupt the aromaticity of the ring.

evalFeedback	10	1	Enolates can act as nucleophiles toward alkyl halides, giving SN2 substitution, or as bases, giving E2 elimination.  When a simple enolate reacts with a secondary alkyl halide, elimination predominates.  The enolate of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, however, is much less basic, so it gives a much greater proportion of substitution.
qStmt	11		Summer exchange student Chava Guttheim draws the mechanism in the Figure for the acid-catalyzed elimination of H2O from the aldol derived from acetone.  Host student Sally Humdinger tells her that her mechanism is incorrect.  What is wrong with Chava's mechanism?
evalFeedback	11	1	The ketone first tautomerizes to the corresponding enol, and then E1 elimination of H2O occurs.  This mechanism gives a much lower energy carbocation intermediate than the one that Chava drew.
qStmt	12		Explain why the compound in the Figure does not undergo a Dieckmann reaction on <i>either</i> side of the ketone.  (The reaction conditions above and below the arrow say, "1.1 equiv. NaOEt, heat.")
evalFeedback	12	1	Neither side gives a Dieckmann product because neither product can be deprotonated: the first product because there are no H atoms on the C between the carbonyls, and the second one because the bridgehead C can't assume sp2 hybridization upon deprotonation.  The first product is also badly strained.
qStmt	13		In Pd-catalyzed reactions such as the Suzuki and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, Pd behaves like what animal?

evalFeedback	6	9	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	6	10	SN2 substitution does not occur at an sp- or sp2-hybridized atom.
evalFeedback	6	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

evalFeedback	9	1	Can&#8217;t do F-C with C(sp2)-Cl as electrophile because C(sp2)-Cl is strong and derived carbocation is high in energy.
evalFeedback	9	2	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	9	4	Good!
qStmt	10		The compound on the left is colorless, but the compound on the right is highly colored. Why?
evalFeedback	10	1	The compound on the right is more conjugated, which gives it a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap, allowing it to absorb energy of longer wavelengths (including visible light) than the compound on the left (UV light only).
qStmt	11		1,3-Cyclopentadiene slowly undergoes a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with itself at room temperature, but the compound shown does so even at temperatures as low as &#8211;100 &#176;C. Why is this compound so much more reactive?
evalFeedback	11	1	Because it is antiaromatic, and hence much higher in energy than 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is nonaromatic.
qStmt	12		Explain why the compound on the left readily reacts with EtNH2 to replace the C-Cl bond with a C-N bond, whereas the compound on the right does not.
evalFeedback	12	1	Nucleophiles react with electron-poor aromatic compounds by an addition-elimination mechanism in which they add to the C that bears a leaving group, pushing electrons onto the neighboring atom in the ring. In the case on the left, this negative charge lands on N, N, and C. In the case on the right, it lands on C, C, C. N is more electronegative than C, so the intermediate from the compound on the left is lower in energy, so the compound on the left reacts more quickly.
qStmt	13		The figure shows an example of a Diels-Alder reaction in which the diene has an O atom replacing a C atom. Using the same kind of analysis that we used to explain the ortho-para rule for the regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction, predict whether compound <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> is the major product of this reaction, and explain your reasoning. (No credit without a reasonable explanation.)
evalFeedback	13	1	Compound A is the major product. The diene has a resonance structure in which the O has a -1 charge and the CH2 has a +1 charge. The dienophile has a resonance structure in which the C atom further from the OEt has a -1 charge. The diene and the dienophile react so that the +1 end on one matches up with the -1 charge on the other.

evalFeedback	1	2	The lowest energy radical intermediate is allylic (3&#176; and 1&#176;), and it reacts with HBr at the less hindered site to give the <i>more substituted</i> of the two possible alkene products.
evalFeedback	1	3	The lowest energy radical intermediate is allylic (3&#176; and 1&#176;).

evalFeedback	7	7	Elimination reactions do not occur by the E2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	7	8	The CH3^+ ion and primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.

evalFeedback	7	11	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	7	12	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	7	13	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	7	14	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	15	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	7	16	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state.  Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.
evalFeedback	7	17	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	7	18	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.

evalFeedback	8	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	8	3	You need an electron-poor dienophile for the Diels-Alder reaction to occur.
evalFeedback	8	4	Good!
qStmt	9		Design a synthesis of the given compound from <b>uncharged, metal-free</b> compounds containing no more than <b>seven contiguous C atoms</b>, plus any compounds from the reaction conditions menu.
evalFeedback	9	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	9	3	Good!
qStmt	10		The equilibrium for the formation of enamines from secondary amines and ketones (top equation) usually lies way on the side of starting materials (<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> << 1). But when ethyl acetoacetate is used as the ketone (bottom equation), the equilibrium lies way on the side of products (<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> >> 1). Explain the anomalous behavior of ethyl acetoacetate.
evalFeedback	10	1	The enamine of ethyl acetoacetate is greatly stabilized by a resonance structure in which the lone pair on N is delocalized onto the carbonyl O of the ester group, pulling the equilibrium to the right. Enamines from "ordinary" ketones lack this resonance stabilization.
qStmt	11		It is easy to abstract the benzylic H atom from the compound on the left, but much more difficult to do so from the compound on the right. Why?
evalFeedback	11	1	The geometry of the compound on the right prevents resonance stabilization of the radical derived from abstracting H&#183; at the bridgehead C, because the p orbitals of the benzene rings are orthogonal to the orbital containing the unpaired electron. In the compound on the left, however, there is no such restriction, and resonance stabilization of the radical by the aromatic p orbitals occurs.
qStmt	12		Undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger tells him it is unlikely to work as written. Why does Sally think (correctly) that it won't work, and what other route could Sally suggest to Will?
evalFeedback	12	1	LiAlH4 reduces esters all the way to alcohols. If he wants the aldehyde, he can oxidize the alcohol to the aldehyde with PCC.
qStmt	13		Iminium ions form extremely rapidly under <i>mildly</i> acidic conditions, but much more slowly under <i>strongly</i> acidic conditions. Why?
evalFeedback	13	1	Under strongly acidic conditions, the N atom of the amine spends all of its time protonated, so it can't act as a nucleophile.

qStmt	8		Undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger tells him it is unlikely to work as written. Why does Sally think (correctly) that it won't work, and what other way of converting the given starting material to the given product could Sally suggest to Will?
evalFeedback	8	1	The product is more nucleophilic than the starting material, so a quaternary salt will be obtained. Use reductive amination with CH2O instead; tertiary amines like the product can't form iminium ions, so they can't undergo further reaction under reductive amination conditions.
qStmt	9		Undergraduate research assistant Will Wurklanghauers plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger tells him it is unlikely to work as written. Why does Sally think (correctly) that it won't work, and what other way of converting the given starting material to the given product could Sally suggest to Will?
evalFeedback	9	1	Again, the product is more reactive than the starting material, so a tertiary amine is likely to be obtained. The best way to add a single CH2R group to a primary amine to give a secondary amine is to make the amide (use an acyl chloride instead of an aldehyde) and reduce with LiAlH4.
qStmt	10		In the compound shown, is the N on the left (bearing the CH3 group) or the N on the right more basic? Explain your answer. (No credit without a correct explanation.)
evalFeedback	10	1	The lone pair of the N on the left is part of an aromatic &#960; system, and the lone pair of the N on the right is not, so the N on the right is more basic. You can also draw more resonance structures of the product ion if you protonate the N on the right.
qStmt	11		Undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger tells her it is unlikely to work as written. Why does Sally think (correctly) that it won't work, and what other way of converting the given starting material to the given product could Sally suggest to Jess?
evalFeedback	11	1	The first step, #a-alkylation, will work fine. The second step will put the CO2Et group on the opposite #a-carbon because the Claisen condensation requires two #a-H atoms (one to substitute, and one to deprotonate afterwards). To obtain the desired product, switch the two steps. The Claisen reaction will give a #b-keto ester, and the alkylation will proceed next to the CO2Et group because deprotonation will occur exclusively at this very acidic site.

evalFeedback	12	9	No atom in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	12	10	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	12	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.

qStmt	14		Design a synthesis of the given compound from <b>benzene, toluene, or any other starting material with four or fewer contiguous C atoms</b>.  You may also use any reagents from the reagents menu. NOTE: The CN group has the same effect on the ability of an aromatic ring to do Friedel-Crafts reactions as does the NO2 group.
evalFeedback	14	1	Use Stille coupling for C(sp3) nucleophiles, not Suzuki coupling.
evalFeedback	14	2	Benzonitrile is resistant to Friedel-Crafts reactions.
evalFeedback	14	3	Benzonitrile is resistant to Friedel-Crafts reactions, and the 1&#176; alkyl halide would undergo a rearrangement reaction anyway.
evalFeedback	14	4	Nitrobenzene is resistant to Friedel-Crafts reactions, and the 1&#176; alkyl halide would undergo a rearrangement reaction anyway.

qStmt	15		Design a synthesis of the target compound from any starting materials containing <b>no more than four contiguous C atoms</b>. You may also use any reagents from the reagents menu.
evalFeedback	15	1	Good effort! Enols C=C-OH are too unstable to be used as starting materials; they tautomerize immediately to carbonyl compounds. But we haven't covered that topic yet, so I'll discount that error.
evalFeedback	15	2	The second step of the synthesis gives the wrong diastereomer of the target. The electron-withdrawing CO2Me groups will be on the dienophile of the Diels-Alder reaction, not on the diene.
evalFeedback	15	3	Your synthesis gives the wrong diastereomer of the target. The electron-withdrawing CO2Me groups will be on the dienophile of the Diels-Alder reaction, not on the diene.

evalFeedback	17	2	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	17	5	Good!
qStmt	18		All dienes contain within themselves a dienophile, yet most dienes do not undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with themselves to give a dimer.  (See the example in the Figure.)  Why not?
evalFeedback	18	1	Diels-Alder reactions usually require an electron-rich dienophile and an electron-poor diene. If a diene also acts as a dienophile, then both the diene and the dienophile are both either electron-rich or electron-poor.
qStmt	19		Give <b>two</b> reasons why compound <b>A</b>, unlike many dienes, doesn't require heating to undergo a Diels-Alder reaction.
evalFeedback	19	1	Because it is locked in the s-cis conformation, and because in this reaction it goes from nonaromatic to aromatic, providing a lot of driving force for the reaction.
qStmt	20		In the compound in the Figure, the electrons in the C(1)=C(2) double bond are strongly polarized toward one of the C atoms of the bond. Why?
evalFeedback	20	1	The electrons in the C^1=C^2 bond are strongly polarized toward C^2 because then both rings are aromatic.
qStmt	21		Is the compound in the figure aromatic, antiaromatic, or nonaromatic?  Explain your answer, including how you treat the triple bond.
evalFeedback	21	1	One of the &#960; bonds of the triple bond overlaps with the adjacent double bonds, whereas the other &#960; bond is orthogonal to them, so the triple bond contributes two electrons to the continuously overlapping cyclic array of p orbitals, giving an even number of electron pairs (six) in the continuously overlapping cyclic array of p orbitals, making the compound is antiaromatic.
qStmt	22		Explain <i>both</i> why the following reaction <i>fails</i> as written and why it <i>succeeds</i> in the presence of a Pd-phosphine catalyst.
evalFeedback	22	1	Amines are good nucleophiles toward alkyl halides in SN2 reactions, but the aryl bromide can't undergo an SN2 substitution because it can't undergo backside attack and inversion. When Pd is present, though, it can do an oxidative addition reaction that breaks the C-Br bond, allowing the amine to substitute the Pd-Br bond with a Pd-N bond. Reductive elimination then gives the product.
qStmt	23		Which compound will react more quickly with EtO^-, and why?  (No credit without an acceptable explanation.)
evalFeedback	23	1	A nucleophile can react with an electron-poor aryl halide such as a halopyridine by an addition-elimination reaction. This mechanism proceeds through a nonaromatic anionic intermediate in which the nucleophile and the leaving group are both attached to a ring C. When the compound on the left reacts, the negative charge of the intermediate is located on two C atoms and the N atom, whereas when the compound on the right reacts, the negative charge of the intermediate is located on three C atoms. N is more electronegative than C, so the intermediate of the compound on the left is lower in energy, so this compound reacts more quickly.
qStmt	24		When the compound in the figure is treated with H2 and Pd/C, its color changes from yellow to nearly colorless.  Why?
evalFeedback	24	1	Hydrogenation converts the double bonds to single bonds, reducing the conjugation, increasing the compound's HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and raising the energy required to promote an electron from the visible region into the UV region.

evalFeedback	12	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate. After the ring ester opens, what acyclic compound will be obtained?
evalFeedback	12	7	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	12	8	Elimination reactions do not occur by the E2 mechanism under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	12	9	SN2 substitution does not occur at an sp- or sp2-hybridized atom.
evalFeedback	12	10	The bond between a leaving group and an sp- or sp2-hybridized atom does not spontaneously ionize.
evalFeedback	12	11	The CH3^+ ion and primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.
evalFeedback	12	12	No intermediate in this mechanism should be a zwitterion.
evalFeedback	12	13	No atom in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	12	14	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	12	15	Two compounds that are both positively or both negatively charged should not react with one another.
evalFeedback	12	16	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	12	17	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	18	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	12	19	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate. How is the new ring bond formed?
evalFeedback	12	20	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state.  Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.
evalFeedback	12	21	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	12	22	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.

qStmt	17		Compound <b>A</b> used to be added to gasoline to make it burn more cleanly. However, it was banned after it started escaping from leaky gasoline storage tanks, passing into the water table, and eventually making its way into the water supply, to which it imparted a noticeable odor. Compound <b>B</b> was proposed as an alternative to <b>A</b>, because <b>B</b> was much more likely to react with oxidizing agents (such as O2) in the environment before it could make it into the water supply. Explain why <b>B</b> is more reactive toward O2 than <b>A</b>.
evalFeedback	17	1	Because compound <b>B</b> can form a 2&#176; radical adjacent to the O atom, whereas compound <b>A</b> can form only a higher energy 1&#176; radical adjacent to the O atom.
qStmt	18		Which are lower in energy, esters or thioesters, and why? (No credit without a correct explanation.)
evalFeedback	18	1	Esters. The energy of a carbonyl compound is determined by the energy of its C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure. O is much closer in size to C than S is, so it has better p orbital overlap with C, so it is a better resonance donor.  As a result, O is better at stabilizing the carbonyl group than S is.
qStmt	19		If CH3Li is added to the compound on the left, is product <b>A</b> more likely to be obtained, or product <b>B</b>? Explain your answer. (No credit without a correct explanation.)
evalFeedback	19	1	<b>A</b>, because aldehydes are higher in energy than esters are. (The noncarbonyl O atom of the ester stabilizes the C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure of the ester through resonance, whereas the H atom does not stabilize the C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure of the aldehyde.) Higher energy carbonyl compounds are more reactive than lower energy ones.
qStmt	20		If CH3Li is added to the compound on the left, is product <b>A</b> more likely to be obtained, or product <b>B</b>? Explain your answer. (No credit without a correct explanation.)
evalFeedback	20	1	<b>A</b>, because ketones are higher in energy than nitriles are. Higher energy carbonyl compounds are more reactive than lower energy ones.
qStmt	21		The phenyl ester on the left reacts much more quickly with MeO^- than the cyclohexyl ester on the right. Why?
evalFeedback	21	1	The ester on the left is higher in energy than the ester on the right, because the lone pairs of the noncarbonyl O atom on the left are partly tied up in resonance with the aromatic ring, so they are less available for resonance stabilization of the C^+&#8211;O^- resonance structure of the carbonyl group than are the lone pairs of the noncarbonyl O atom on the right.

You should consider using the word "whereas" in your response, as in, "Under acidic conditions, the reaction occurs in this way, whereas under basic conditions, the reaction doesn't occur because..."
evalFeedback	11	1	The second step in acetal formation is a substitution at C(sp3) of OH with OR. OH is a terrible leaving group under basic conditions, and the C is rather crowded, so this reaction can only proceed by an SN1 mechanism, which requires acidic conditions.
qStmt	12		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that she is unlikely to get a good yield of product.  Why is Sally so pessimistic?
evalFeedback	12	1	Because moderate base is used, and the base continues to be present as product starts to form, the base can deprotonate either starting material or product, so multiple alkylation products will form.
qStmt	13		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that she is unlikely to get a good yield of product.  Why is Sally so pessimistic?
evalFeedback	13	1	Under acidic conditions, #a-bromination of carbonyl compounds occurs via the enol. Esters are very low in energy, so the proportion of enol that forms from them is very, very small, so #a-bromination is extremely slow, essentially not observed.
qStmt	14		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that she is unlikely to get a good yield of product.  Why is Sally so pessimistic?
evalFeedback	14	1	Aldehydes can't be deprotonated cleanly with LDA. They are so electrophilic that as soon as some of the aldehyde in solution is deprotonated, it will react with not-yet-deprotonated aldehyde.
qStmt	15		Explain why the reaction in the Figure is unlikely to work as written, and suggest how you can modify the reagents or the reaction conditions to obtain the product shown.
qStmt	16		Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger carries out the reaction in the Figure, expecting to get only product <b>A</b>.  Instead, she obtains two products, <b>A</b> (major) and <b>B</b> (minor).  Look at the intermediate enolate in Sally's reaction, hypothesize about what other product(s) might be obtained from the reaction of this enolate with CH3I, see which product(s) have a structure that is consistent with the spectral information below, and propose a <i>single</i> structure for Sally&#8217;s unexpected product <b>B</b>. <b>Note</b>: You can still get full or partial credit on this question even if you do not remember anything about spectroscopy; the spectra simply help you determine which of the possible products is the actual one.

<ul>
<li>The MS of <b>B</b> shows a parent ion at 128 amu (same as <b>A</b>).  </li>
<li>The IR spectrum of <b>B</b> shows a very strong absorbance at 1726 cm^^-1 and a smaller but still strong and sharp absorbance at 1662 cm^^-1.  </li>
<li>The 1H NMR spectrum of <b>B</b> shows &#948; 6.90 (dt, 1H), 5.76 (d, J = 15 Hz, 1H), 4.21 (q, 2H), 2.26 (dq, 2H), 1.30 (t, 3H), and 1.09 (t, 3H).  </li>
<li>The proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of <b>B</b> shows &delta; 167.0, 144.7, 122.6, 51.3, 25.5, 15.0, and 12.1.  </li>
</ul>
evalFeedback	16	1	Good! The 1H NMR spectrum shows two H atoms in the alkene region, suggesting a disubstituted alkene. Their coupling constant suggests a trans alkene.
evalFeedback	16	2	What does the 15 Hz coupling constant for the alkene H tell you about the double bond stereochemistry?
evalFeedback	16	3	Good hypothesis, but it's ruled out by the spectra. The IR spectrum shows that you still have a carbonyl group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows only two H atoms in the alkenyl region.
evalFeedback	16	4	Draw the enolate, draw a resonance structure, and try to predict what other compound could be obtained in this reaction.
qStmt	17		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown.  Senior undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that it would work on <i>most</i> diesters, but not <i>this</i> diester.  Why is Sally so pessimistic?
evalFeedback	17	1	Grignard reagents are strong bases, and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds are very acidic, so the Grignard reagent will only deprotonate the diester.
qStmt	18		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the following reaction. <b>Draw in the H atoms near the reactive centers!</b>

qStmt	19		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov proposes to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger looks at the proposed reaction and tells Jess that it is unlikely to work well. What does Sally explain is likely to happen instead?
evalFeedback	19	1	The nucleophile is a good one, but it is also a good base; with a secondary alkyl halide, it is more prone to do elimination than substitution.
qStmt	20		Summer exchange student Chava Guttheim draws the mechanism in the Figure for the acid-catalyzed elimination of H2O from the aldol derived from acetone.  Host student Sally Humdinger tells her that her mechanism is incorrect.  What is wrong with Chava's mechanism?
evalFeedback	20	1	The ketone destabilizes the intermediate carbocation. It needs to first tautomerize to the enol so that the carbocation intermediate is stabilized by resonance and hence is much lower in energy.
qStmt	21		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger looks at the planned reaction, tells Jess that it won't work, and then leaves the room. Jess wants to know why her planned reaction won't work. Explain to Jess why it won't work as written.
evalFeedback	21	1	The Dieckmann reaction requires that the nucleophile ester have two H atoms on the #a-carbon so that the product can be deprotonated. In the given reaction, the ester <i>not</i> directly attached to the ring will act as the nucleophile, and a different product will be obtained.
qStmt	22		When diketo ester <b>A</b> is treated with catalytic base, bicyclic compound <b>B</b> is obtained quickly. However, as the reaction proceeds, <b>B</b> reverts back to <b>A</b>, and a different product, <b>C</b>, that has a different carbon skeleton from <b>B</b> forms in its place. Why does <b>B</b> revert back to <b>A</b>? (The 3D structure of <b>B</b> is provided in Figure 2. If you launch MarvinView, you can rotate the structure in space by click-holding and dragging.)
evalFeedback	22	1	The aldol reaction is driven by the elimination of H2O to make an #a,#b-unsaturated carbonyl compound. If H2O can't be eliminated, the reaction often reverses. Compound <b>B</b> can't eliminate H2O because the product have a bridgehead alkene, which would be highly strained (violates Bredt's Rule), so it undergoes retro-aldol reaction to give <b>A</b>. Eventually <b>A</b> converts to a different aldol product by a slower pathway.
qStmt	23		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov plans to carry out the reaction shown. Graduate student Sally Humdinger looks at the planned reaction, tells Jess that it won't work, and then leaves the room. Jess wants to know why her planned reaction won't work. Explain to Jess why it won't work as written. (It is insufficient to tell her that the reaction would work if she did it a different way. She wants to know why it won't work as written.)
evalFeedback	23	1	The Dieckmann reaction requires a full equivalent of base because the product is highly acidic, and it consumes base as it is produced.
qStmt	24		New undergraduate research assistant Jess Gudinov carries out the first reaction, and it works great.  She then tries to carry out the second reaction, and it doesn't work at all -- she gets dimerizations from aldehydes reacting with aldehydes, but the ester doesn't react at all.  Explain why the ester-aldehyde doesn't cyclize like the dialdehyde does.
evalFeedback	24	1	Esters are much lower in energy than aldehydes, so they are much less prone to form enols, which are the active nucleophilic species under acidic conditions. Without a sufficient concentration of enol in solution, the acid-catalyzed aldol reaction simply won't proceed.
Topic: CHE 532 exams; Set: Fall 2003 midterm
qStmt	1		Undergraduate research assistant Bartholomew Humdinger has carried out the following synthetic sequence:

<blockquote>
PhCH2OH &rarr; PhCH2Cl &rarr; PhCH2CN &rarr; PhCH2CH2NH2 &rarr; PhCH2CH2NHAc
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, Bart stored the compounds in unlabelled bottles. When his research advisor finds out what Bart has done, he tells him to take IR spectra of the five compounds. Help Bart identify which bottles contain which compounds by choosing the IR spectrum that corresponds to each compound. For example, if you decide that Figure 1 is the spectrum of PhCH2CN, then select 1 from the pulldown menu next to PhCH2CN.
qdText	1	1	PhCH2OH
qdText	1	2	PhCH2Cl
qdText	1	3	PhCH2CN
qdText	1	4	PhCH2CH2NH2
qdText	1	5	PhCH2CH2NHAc
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!
evalFeedback	1	2	What very prominent feature do you expect to see in the IR spectrum of PhCH2OH?
evalFeedback	1	3	What very prominent feature do you expect to see in the IR spectrum of PhCH2CN?
evalFeedback	1	4	What very prominent feature do you expect to see in the IR spectrum of PhCH2CH2NHAc?
evalFeedback	1	5	What very prominent feature do you expect to see in the IR spectrum of PhCH2CH2NH2?
qStmt	2		The IR and mass spectra of an unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. Is N, Si, S, Cl, or Br present? How many of each? State the evidence.
evalFeedback	2	1	There is no M+2 peak, so there are no S, Si, Cl, or Br atoms present. The M^+ ion's mass is even, so there must be an even number of N atoms, probably 0.
qStmt	3		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. Considering <b>all</b> of the given evidence (not just the M^+ ion in the MS spectrum), what is the maximum number of C atoms that this compound could contain?
evalFeedback	3	1	Good! IR shows a strong C=O absorbance, so compound must contain O. Remainder of formula must fit within 84, = C6H12.
evalFeedback	3	2	What is the maximum number of C atoms that can fit in 100 amu?
evalFeedback	3	3	What functional group does the IR spectrum indicate must be present? Accounting for the weight of the element that this functional group contains, what is the maximum number of C atoms that can be present?
evalFeedback	3	4	There is no evidence for this few C atoms.
qStmt	4		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. Propose a molecular formula that is consistent with the MS data.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	Your formula doesn't have the correct molecular mass.
evalFeedback	4	3	What functional group does the IR spectrum indicate is present? What element must therefore be present in the formula?
evalFeedback	4	4	No, try again.
qStmt	5		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. How many degrees of unsaturation does <b>A</b> have?
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!
evalFeedback	5	2	No, try again.
qStmt	6		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. What functional group or groups are present? State the evidence.
evalFeedback	6	1	An absorbance near 1710 cm^^-1 indicates a ketone.
qStmt	7		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. Draw a structure for <b>A</b> that is consistent with the IR and MS spectra, including, as far as possible, the MS fragmentation pattern.
evalFeedback	7	1	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	7	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	3	What must be the formula of the compound?
evalFeedback	7	4	What functional group must be present?
evalFeedback	7	5	Good!
evalFeedback	7	6	A methyl ketone should show a prominent fragment at M &#8211; 15, not a very small one as observed.
evalFeedback	7	7	A very reasonable answer, but this compound cannot undergo a McLafferty rearrangement, whereas there is an M &#8211; 28 peak that is larger than one would expect from the M + 1 peak associated with the fragment at M &#8211; 29.
qStmt	8		The IR and mass spectra of <b>the same</b> unknown compound, <b>A</b>, are provided. Normally we think that a small M + 1 peak is due to 13C, but the ratio of peaks at 72 and 71 amu in the MS of <b>A</b> is larger than the ratio of peaks at 101 and 100, even though the fragment can&#8217;t have more C atoms than the molecular ion.  Explain why the peak at 72 amu is higher than expected.
evalFeedback	8	1	This compound can undergo a McLafferty rearrangement, in which the fragmentation is accmopnaied by a transfer of H back to one of the fragments, making its mass even.
qStmt	9		Explain why 1,3,5-tribromobenzene shows MS peaks at every integer from 312 to 319 amu.
evalFeedback	9	1	The mass is 312 amu, for an isotopomer that contains three ^79Br atoms and no ^81Br atoms. It will also show peaks at 314, 316, and 318 for isotopomers that contain one, two, or three ^81Br atoms, respectively. Each of these isotopomers will also show an M+1 peak due to the presence of one ^13C atom.
qStmt	10		Explain why primary alcohols RCH2OH often show a molecular ion, but tertiary alcohols R3COH rarely do.
evalFeedback	10	1	A 3&#176; alcohol gives a radical cation that fragments to give a lower energy oxonium (more substituted cationic C atom) than does a 1&#176; alcohol.
qStmt	11		Explain why an IR spectrum of a conformationally mobile compound consists of the sum of the IR spectra of the individual conformers, whereas the NMR spectrum consists of the average NMR spectrum of the individual conformers.
evalFeedback	11	1	The time scale of the IR experiment is on the order of molecular vibrations, femtoseconds, much faster than the interconversion of conformers. The time scale of the NMR experiment is on the order of microoseconds, much slower than the interconversion of conformers.
qStmt	12		Bart&#8217;s older sister, Sally Humdinger, is assigned the task of determining the structures of an unknown compound. The unknown is one of the two compounds shown. The two options have the same molecular weight. Tell Sally what feature of the low-resolution MS of her unknown will allow her to distinguish unambiguously between the two possible structures, and explain your answer.
evalFeedback	12	1	If the peak at 143 amu is 11% of the height of the peak at 142 amu, you have decane, whereas if it is only 1%, you have CH3I. Alternatively, if you see fragments due to loss of CH3CH2, CH3CH2CH2, etc., you have decane. If all you see is a CH3 fragment, you have CH3I.
qStmt	13		Bart&#8217;s older sister, Sally Humdinger, is assigned the task of determining the structures of an unknown compound. The unknown is one of the two compounds shown. The two options have the same molecular weight. Tell Sally what feature of the low-resolution MS of her unknown will allow her to distinguish unambiguously between the two possible structures, and explain your answer.
evalFeedback	13	1	Sulfides fragment primarily by #b-scission. Dipropyl sulfide can lose CH3CH2 by #b-scission, but diisopropyl sulfide cannot. So, if you see a prominent loss of CH3CH2, you have dipropyl sulfide; if you don't, and instead, loss of CH3 is prominent, you have diisopropyl sulfide.
qStmt	14		Label H atoms that <i>may</i> have different chemical shifts (are diastereotopic, are magnetically inequivalent) with different map numbers, and label H atoms that <i>must</i> have the same chemical shift (are homotopic or enantiotopic, are magnetically equivalent) with the same map numbers.  To do so, right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the atom, select <b>Atom properties</b>, uncheck the box to the right of <b>Map</b>, enter the appropriate number (enter 0 to remove a map), and press <b>Ok</b>. You can also use the Select button to select two or more atoms and then follow the procedure above to give them the same map number all at once.
evalFeedback	14	1	Do not alter the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	14	2	Good! There is an axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the screen, relating the right half of the molecule to the left half, and there is a plane of symmetry in the plane of the screen, relating one Et group on each side to the other Et group on that side, but the two H atoms of the CH2 groups are not related by either element of symmetry.
evalFeedback	14	3	You might want to try the isotopic substitution test on one or more pairs of H atoms.
evalFeedback	14	4	You might want to try the isotopic substitution test on one or more pairs of H atoms. It appears that you may also have forgotten to label or mislabeled one or more H atoms.
evalFeedback	14	5	Label only the H atoms.
evalFeedback	14	6	Either you failed to label an H atom, or you labeled one or more incorrectly.
Topic: CHE 532 exams; Set: Fall 2003 final
qStmt	1		Explain why elemental analysis is an unreliable method for the determination of molecular formula.
evalFeedback	1	1	One obtains a ratio of elements from EA, not a formula. Even small errors in EA can skew the results enough to make it difficult to discern the correct formula.
qStmt	2		Explain why the mass spectrum of a compound will not always tell you the compound's molecular weight.
evalFeedback	2	1	Fragmentation of the molecular ion can occur 100% of the time, so only fragments may be observed.
qStmt	3		Explain why one cannot reliably integrate the 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	3	1	Because accurate integration requires that the nuclear spin relax completely between pulses, and 13C nuclei relax extremely slowly, so we don't normally wait for relaxation to occur between pulses in 13C NMR.
qStmt	4		Explain why in 13C NMR spectra, propargylic C atoms (C&#8801;C&#8211;<u>C</u>) generally resonate upfield of allylic C atoms (C=C&#8211;<u>C</u>), even though C(sp) is more electronegative than C(sp2).
evalFeedback	4	1	The triple bond creates a torus of electron density that, in the presence of a magnetic field, induces its own magnetic field that is strongly shielding over the hole of the torus and deshielding outside it. The alkyne H atom resides in that deshielding region over the hole.
qStmt	5		The spectra of an unknown compound are provided. What is the formula of the compound?
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!
evalFeedback	5	2	What is signified by the peaks of equal height at 228 and 230 amu?
evalFeedback	5	3	What functional group is signified by the IR absorbance at 1722 cm^^-1 and the 13C NMR resonance at 165.2 ppm? What implication does it have for the formula?
evalFeedback	5	4	What must be the mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	5	5	No, try again.
qStmt	6		The spectra of the same unknown compound are provided.  What functional group(s) is (are) present in the compound?
evalFeedback	6	1	IR says a carbonyl. Closer to a ketone than an ester, but could be #a,#b-unsaturated ester. 13C NMR says an ester (165 ppm) and a benzene ring (120&#8211;140 ppm). So we have an #a,#b-unsaturated ester.

evalFeedback	7	8	What functional group is signified by the 1H NMR resonances downfield of 7 ppm and the six 13C NMR resonances at 120&#8211;140 ppm?
evalFeedback	7	9	What group is signified by the 2 H quartet at 4.3 ppm and the 3 H triplet at 1.4 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	10	Considering the chemical shift of the resonance arising from the CH2 group, to what atom must the Et group be attached?
evalFeedback	7	11	How many aromatic resonances would this compound show in the ^1H or ^13C NMR spectrum?

<p>HMBC: The compound on the right will show a correlation between the H atoms of the CH3 group and a quaternary C atom. The compound on the left will not.

In both compounds, it will be a ddd, but in the compound on the left, it will have three small coupling constants, whereas in the compound on the right, it will have two large ones and one small one.
<p>NOESY: In the compound on the right, there should be NOE interactions between H^6 and the axial H^4 and H^8. In the compound on the left, there may be NOE interactions between H^6 and equatorial H^4, but that's all. However, it may be hard to assign resonances to H^4 and H^8 unambiguously, so this solution is much more difficult.

The two compounds have the same molecular weight. Tell Sally what feature of the low-resolution MS of her unknown will allow her to assign one of the two structures unambiguously to her unknown, and explain your answer. Note that you have the spectrum of only one compound, so your answer shouldn't compare the two compounds, but should instead point to a feature in the spectrum whose presence, absence, or size will allow you to rule out one or the other compound.

The two compounds have the same molecular weight. Tell Sally what feature of the low-resolution MS of her unknown will allow her to assign one of the two structures unambiguously to her unknown, and explain your answer. Note that you have the spectrum of only one compound, so your answer shouldn't compare the two compounds, but should instead point to a feature in the spectrum whose presence, absence, or size will allow you to rule out one or the other compound.
evalFeedback	4	1	The compound on the left will show a prominent M &#8211; 29 peak for loss of an Et group. The compound on the right will not. (The compound on the right is most likely to lose ClC6H4CH2, not CH3.)
qStmt	5		A compound has an elemental analysis of 52.38% C, 7.62% H, and 12.10% N, and its MS shows a molecular ion at 115 amu with no significant M+2 peak. Draw <b>four</b> distinct structures that are consistent with this information. (Diastereomers are distinct; enantiomers are not.)

evalFeedback	6	1	Good!
evalFeedback	6	2	Ack! You did not label correctly the two H atoms of the ClCH2 group on the right, relative to the left. The plane of symmetry means that the forward H atom on the left is enantiotopic to the forward H atom on the right, not the backward H atom on the right.

evalFeedback	7	1	Good!
evalFeedback	7	2	Ack! You did not label correctly the two H atoms of the ClCH2 group on the right, relative to the left. The axis of symmetry means that the forward H atom on the left is homotopic to the backward H atom on the right, not the forward H atom on the right.
evalFeedback	7	3	The H atoms at 6:00 are homotopic.
evalFeedback	7	4	The two H atoms of the CH2 groups at 4:00 and 8:00 are diastereotopic. The axis of symmetry does not related the forward H atom at 4:00 to the backward H atom at 4:00, although it does relate the forward H atom at 4:00 to the backward H atom at 8:00.
evalFeedback	7	5	The H atoms in each CH2Cl group are diastereotopic.

evalFeedback	8	1	At least one of your values is incorrect.
evalFeedback	8	2	Good!  You have completed the table correctly.  (Ignore the coloring of the cell.)
qStmt	9		The following MS spectrum has been reported for a compound. The only reported absorbance in the interpretable region of the IR spectrum is 1730 cm^^-1. Assuming that the only other IR absorbances in the interpretable region are the C(sp3)&#8211;H absorbances at 2800&#8211;3000 cm^^-1, propose <b>one</b> structure for the compound. (There is more than one correct answer.)
evalFeedback	9	1	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	9	2	Good!
evalFeedback	9	3	This compound would also show a strong absorbance for the C=C bond, but it's a good guess.
evalFeedback	9	4	Close, but an ester that is part of a ring that has 5 members or fewer will absorb at at least 1750 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	9	5	Close, but the C-C &#960; bond would also show an absorbance in the interpretable region.
evalFeedback	9	6	Close, but a conjugated ester would absorb at lower energy in the IR spectrum.
evalFeedback	9	7	An aldehyde would also show an absorbance at around 2700 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	9	8	A conjugated aldehyde would absorb at lower frequency in the IR. An aldehyde would also show an absorbance at around 2700 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	9	9	Your response has the correct molecular weight, but it doesn't account for the IR absorbance.
evalFeedback	9	10	Yes, the compound is an ester, but your response has the wrong molecular weight.
evalFeedback	9	11	Your response has the wrong molecular weight and doesn't account for the IR data.
qStmt	10		Explain why the largest peak in the MS of the compound in the figure (mass 144 amu) is at 88 amu.
evalFeedback	10	1	McLafferty rearrangement on the left leads to loss of CH2=C(CH3)2, 56 amu.
qStmt	11		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger ran a reaction that she expected to lead to the compound shown in the figure. She took an IR spectrum of her product, expecting to see an IR absorbance at around 1600 cm^^-1 for the C=C bond, but it was absent, so she tearfully concluded that the reaction didn't work as expected. Was she right to conclude that the reaction didn't work as expected, or was she wrong? Explain your answer.
evalFeedback	11	1	She was wrong. The alkene is symmetrical, so you don't expect to see an IR absorbance for it.
Topic: CHE 532 exams; Set: Fall 2015 final
qStmt	1		The NMR data for 1-ethynylnaphthalene have been reported as follows:
<blockquote>
1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) &#948; 8.36 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.82 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.73 (d, J = 6.2 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (dd, J = 19.3, 7.3 Hz, 2H), 7.39 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 1H), 3.46 (s, 1H). 
</blockquote>
The resonance at &#948; 8.36 is much further downfield than the others. Choose the H atom in 1-ethynylnaphthalene that gives rise to this downfield resonance, and explain why it is so far downfield. Your explanation must be correct to earn credit.

evalFeedback	1	1	Yes! The torus of electron density formed by the &#960; bonds of the triple bond create a deshielding region outside the alkyne, and hydrogen g is sitting directly in this region.
evalFeedback	1	2	The torus of electron density formed by the &#960; bonds of the triple bond create a deshielding region outside the alkyne. Hydrogen a is near the triple bond, but hydrogen g is even closer to it.
evalFeedback	1	3	The torus of electron density formed by the &#960; bonds of the triple bond create a deshielding region outside the alkyne, and hydrogen g is sitting directly in this region.
qStmt	2		The NMR data for 1-ethynylnaphthalene have been reported as follows:
<blockquote>
1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) &#948; 8.36 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.82 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.73 (d, J = 6.2 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (dd, J = 19.3, 7.3 Hz, 2H), 7.39 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 1H), 3.46 (s, 1H). 
</blockquote>
One of the coupling constants is almost certainly reported incorrectly. Which one, and how do you know it is wrong?
evalFeedback	2	1	The coupling constant of 19.3 Hz is wrong. Coupling constants that large can only be due to 2-bond coupling or trans-alkene coupling, neither of which is present in this compound.
qStmt	3		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger took a proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of Ph3P (Figure 1). Sally knew that all three Ph groups of Ph3P were equivalent, and she knew that Ph groups show four resonances in the 13C NMR spectrum due to rotational averaging of the ortho and meta C atoms. She was surprised to see that the 13C NMR spectrum of Ph3P contained <i>seven lines</i>, not four. Explain to Sally why the spectrum shows seven lines. Your explanation should account for the exact number to earn full credit.
evalFeedback	3	1	P has a spin of 1/2, so it engages in 1-, 2-, and 3-bond coupling with the C atoms of the phenyl ring, splitting the resonances of the ipso, ortho, and meta C atoms into doublets. The P&#8211;C 4-bond coupling is too small to observe, so the para C atom remains a singlet.
qStmt	4		The MS, IR, 500 MHz 1H NMR, and 125 MHz 13C NMR spectra of an unknown compound are provided. Draw the structure of the compound that best matches the spectra.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good! The IR and 1H NMR spectra indicate a carboxylic acid, and the 1H NMR spectrum indicates a para-disubstitiuted aromatic compound. The molecular ion at 166 amu has at least two O atoms, weighing 32 together, and 166 &#8211; 32 = 134, so the formula could be C11H2O2, but that seems unlikely. A more likely possibility is C10H14O2, but it has &Omega; = 4, which is insufficient for the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. A better answer is C9H10O3. The 3H singlet at 3.8 ppm and the 13C NMR resonance at 55.2 ppm indicate a CH3O group. With an additional 2H singlet at 3.6 ppm, the best answer is 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid. The 2H singlet at 3.6 ppm is further downfield than one might expect due to the combined deshielding effects of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	4	2	If this compound were the unknown, then the IR absorbance of the carbonyl group would be at lower energy, and the resonance at 40.0 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum would be further downfield due to the deshielding effect of O.
evalFeedback	4	3	The IR spectrum doesn't support an ester and a phenol. What functional groups are more likely to be present?
evalFeedback	4	4	The IR spectrum doesn't support an ester and a phenol. What functional groups are more likely to be present? Also, if this compound were the unknown, then the IR absorbance of the carbonyl group would be at lower energy.
evalFeedback	4	5	The integration of the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum is inconsistent this compound, as is the multiplicity of the two upfield resonances.
evalFeedback	4	6	If this were the compound, you would have a 2 H quartet and a 3 H triplet in the 1H NMR spectrum. Also, the IR absorbance of the carbonyl group would be at lower energy than it is.
evalFeedback	4	7	You have the right formula and the right functional groups. What does the 1H NMR spectrum tell you about the substitution pattern around the benzene ring?
evalFeedback	4	8	What should be the weight of the compound?
evalFeedback	4	9	What functional group is indicated by the IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	10	What functional group do the two downfield resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum indicate?
evalFeedback	4	11	What substitution pattern on the benzene ring is indicated by the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	12	How many H atoms are indicated by the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	13	What substitution pattern of the aromatic ring is indicated by the 1H NMR spectrum? What implication does it have for the number of C atoms in the compound?
evalFeedback	4	14	What formula is indicated by the mass, the integration of the 1H NMR spectrum, and the number of peaks in the 13C NMR spectrum (accounting for the effect of the aromatic ring's rotational symmetry on the number of resonances).
evalFeedback	4	15	If the compound contained an alcohol in addition to the carboxylic acid, there would be another resonance integrating to 1.

evalFeedback	7	1	Excellent!
evalFeedback	7	2	Close, but of the two resonances around 4.9 ppm, the one with the larger doublet coupling constant would correspond to H^2, not H^1, because H^2 is trans to the H^3 and H^1 is cis to it.
evalFeedback	7	3	Close, but why would H^8 be a quartet, and H^7 a triplet?
evalFeedback	7	4	In what chemical shift range must you find H^1, H^2, and H^3? To which resonances must they therefore correspond?

evalFeedback	7	6	In what chemical shift range must you find H^7? To which resonance must it therefore correspond?
evalFeedback	7	7	There are two resonances that have a chemical shift that could correspond to H^7. Given that there is coupling of H^7 to H^8, which of the two resonances must correspond to H^7?
evalFeedback	7	8	In what chemical shift range must you find H^4? To which resonance must it therefore correspond?
evalFeedback	7	9	Which two H atoms will have the most upfield chemical shifts?
evalFeedback	7	10	Use the COSY to determine whether the resonance at 1.36 ppm is H^5 (couples to resonance from H^4) and the resonance at 1.47 ppm is H^6 (couples to resonance from H^7), or vice versa.

evalFeedback	8	1	HMBC is the only reliable way to do it. In the compound on the left, the two H^3 atoms will couple to both quaternary aromatic C atoms, whereas in the compound on the right, they will couple to only one of them.<p>If you can observe coupling to the OH, then the OH on the left will be a doublet, and the OH on the left will be a triplet.

If this C is attached to a C attached to a C attached to a CH3 group (identified by DEPT), we have the top compound. If not, we have the bottom one. Similar argument can be made using COSY. But perhaps the simplest answer is to use MS. The top compound will show an abundant fragment at M &#8211;&#160;43, whereas the bottom will show one at M &#8211; 57.

NOESY might also work well. In the first compound, there should be an NOE interaction between the 3 H singlet and both aromatic H atoms; whereas in the second compound, there should be an NOE interaction between the 3 H singlet and only one aromatic H atom. INADEQUATE will also work well. In the compound on the left, one of the CH3 C atoms will be attached to a C atom with a chemical shift around 100 ppm (because it is not attached to O), whereas in the compound on the right, one of the CH3 C atoms will be attached to a C atom with a chemical shift around 140 ppm (because it is attached to O).

evalFeedback	14	1	Good!
qStmt	15		The compound shown in Figure 1 was produced by an enzyme. The compound's configurations at C^13 and C^16 were unknown, so its NOESY spectrum was obtained. Use the NOESY spectrum to determine the configurations at C^13 and C^16, and submit as your response the structure with the configurations at C^13 and C^16 correctly indicated. You will earn no credit if you properly indicate configuration at only one or the other.

<p>The best way to indicate the proper configurations is to change the C^13&#8211;H and C^16&#8211;H bonds to make them bold or hashed.

You can change the C^13&#8211;C^12 bond instead of the C^13&#8211;H bond, and you can change the C^16&#8211;C^17 bond instead of the C^16&#8211;H bond, if you prefer.

evalFeedback	7	1	1H NMR is best. In the compound on the left, the most downfield dd will show one small and one large coupling constant, whereas in the compound on the right, the most downfield dd will show two small coupling constants. You can also use NOESY: In the compound on the left, H^3 will show an NOE interaction to one of the H atoms on C^1 (can be identified by their chemical shift around 2.1 ppm), whereas in the compound on the right, H^3 will not show an NOE interaction to either of the H atoms on C^1.
qStmt	8		The compound shown in Figure 1 was produced by an enzyme. The compound's configurations at C^13 and C^16 were unknown, so its NOESY spectrum was obtained. Use the NOESY spectrum to determine the configurations at C^13 and C^16, and submit as your response the structure with the configurations at C^13 and C^16 correctly indicated. You will earn no credit if you properly indicate configuration at only one or the other.

<p>The best way to indicate the proper configurations is to change the C^13&#8211;H and C^16&#8211;H bonds to make them bold or hashed: 
right-click on the bond, choose Bond properties, choose Up (or Down) from the Type menu, and press Ok.
You can change the C^13&#8211;C^12 bond instead of the C^13&#8211;H bond, and you can change the C^16&#8211;C^17 bond instead of the C^16&#8211;H bond, if you prefer.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good! H^16 shows strong NOEs to H^14 and H^15, whereas H^13 does not. Instead, H^13 shows a strong NOE to H^17.

evalFeedback	8	3	How do you explain the strong NOE between H^13 and H^17?
evalFeedback	8	4	How do you explain the strong NOE from H^16 to H^14 and H^15, and the weak NOE from H^13 to H^14 and H^15?
evalFeedback	8	5	You must indicate the configuration at both C^13 and C^16 to earn credit.
qStmt	9		Determine the value of each coupling constant leading to the multiplet in the Figure.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!
qStmt	10		A biochemist carried out the reaction in the Figure and got a single product, which he knew was either the threo or the erythro product shown. He dissolved his product in a solution of NaOD in D2O and took a 1H NMR spectrum. Explain how the 1H NMR spectrum showed him which isomer he had.
evalFeedback	10	1	Under basic conditions, the two CO2H groups are both deprotonated and negatively charged, so they are anti to one another (as drawn). In the threo isomer, the C(2) and C(3) H atoms are gauche when the CO2H groups are anti, whereas in the erythro isomer, the C(2) and C(3) H atoms are anti when the CO2H groups are anti. A small H(2)&#8211;H(3) coupling constant (around 4 Hz) indicates the threo isomer, whereas a larger H(2)&#8211;H(3) coupling constant (around 8 Hz) indicates the erythro isomer.
qStmt	11		The compound shown in Figure 1 gives rise to the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, and HSQC spectra shown in the remaining figures. Assign each 1H NMR resonance (lower-case letters a&#8211;h) and 13C NMR resonance (upper-case letters A&#8211;H) to the appropriate H or C atom. Notes: <ul><li>The spectra were taken in CDCl3 on a 500 MHz spectrometer.</li><li>If you are assigning diastereotopic H atoms to different resonances, don't worry about which diastereotopic H atom corresponds to which resonance.</li></ul>
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!
evalFeedback	11	2	Almost. Look at the COSY spectrum. If you're very careful, you can distinguish the crosspeaks of resonance c (H(5)) from those of resonance d (H(21) and H(22)). Does resonance c correlate to resonance e or resonances f and g? What does that tell you about the assignments of these resonances?
qStmt	12		The IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HSQC, and COSY spectra of a compound of molecular weight 126 amu are provided. What is the formula of the compound?
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!
evalFeedback	12	2	Formula is consistent with molecular weight but not with 1H NMR integration or IR spectrum.
evalFeedback	12	3	Nope, try again.
qStmt	13		The IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HSQC, and COSY spectra of a compound of molecular weight 126 amu are provided. What is the structure of the compound?
evalFeedback	13	1	Good! The IR spectrum indicates a carboxylic acid and a terminal alkyne, and the 1H NMR spectrum indicates four CH2 groups plus the H of the alkyne, and that's pretty much all you need to know to solve this problem.
evalFeedback	13	2	The functional groups are correct, and so is the formula. Pay attention to the 1H NMR integrations to see the structure.
evalFeedback	13	3	What do the IR absorbances at 3298 and 2118 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	13	4	Right formula, wrong structure.
evalFeedback	13	5	What functional group does the IR absorbance at 1709 cm^^-1 indicate?
evalFeedback	13	6	If this compound contained an alcohol, the IR absorbance would not be nearly as broad as is observed in the IR spectrum.
evalFeedback	13	7	What does the broad IR absorbance at 2700-3500 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	13	8	What do the IR absorbances at 3298 and 2118 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	13	9	The formula is incorrect.
qStmt	14		The 300 MHz 1H NMR spectrum of the compound in Figure 1 was reported as follows: &delta; 2.45 (m, 2H), 3.2 (m, 2H), 5.1 (ddd, 50 Hz, 10 Hz, 6 Hz, 1H), 7.2&#8211;8.2 (m, 4H). Which H atom gives rise to the resonance at 5.1 ppm, why is it a ddd, and why is such a large coupling constant (50 Hz) observed? (I've numbered the C atoms to help you refer to particular atoms in your explanation.)
evalFeedback	14	1	H^2 gives rise to the resonance at 5.1 ppm. It a ddd due to coupling to F and to the two diastereotopic H atoms on C^3. The large coupling constant (50 Hz) is due to 2-bond coupling to F.

qStmt	1		The structure of a compound is shown twice in Figure 1, and its 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HSQC, and COSY spectra, measured in D2O on a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer, are shown in subsequent figures. The 1H NMR resonances are labeled a&#8211;i, and the 13C NMR resonances are labeled A&#8211;K. (The 1H NMR resonance labeled HOD is from the solvent.) Assign the appropriate 1H NMR resonances (from among letters a&#8211;i) and 13C NMR resonances (from among letters A&#8211;K) to the H atoms numbered up to 5 on the top structure and to the C atoms numbered up to 6 on the bottom structure.

</li><li>In the 1H NMR spectrum, integrations are given below each resonance. 
</li><li> In the 13C NMR spectrum, resonance C is small and slightly downfield of resonance D.
</li><li>In the HSQC spectrum, 13C NMR resonances A&#8211;C are omitted because they do not correlate to any 1H NMR resonances.

evalFeedback	1	1	Perfect! C^6 is the most downfield of the aromatic C atoms because of the inductive withdrawing effect of O. H^4 and C^4 are downfield of H^5 and C^5, respectively, due to resonance effects of the acetyl group.

<ol><li>No OH resonances are observed due to H/D exchange with solvent.
</li><li>In the 1H NMR spectrum, integrations are given below each resonance. 
</li><li>1H NMR resonance g integrates to 2 H, so you will need to assign it to two different H atoms.
</li><li>You can tell which two resonances correspond to H^121 and H^122, but you can't tell which resonance goes with which H atom, so just choose one of the two possibilities.

evalFeedback	6	1	Good!
qStmt	7		The compound in Figure 1 gives rise to the partial COSY and NOESY spectra in the subsequent figures. H^21 resonates at 2.68 ppm. Use the COSY spectrum to assign H^22, H^3, and H^4 to the remaining resonances in the spectra. Then use the NOESY spectrum to determine the orientations of H^3 and H^4 (up or down) relative to H^21. Finally, change the C&#8211;H^3 and C&#8211;H^4 bonds to bold or hashed wedges to show their correct orientations relative to H^21, and submit.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good! The COSY shows that H^21 (2.68 ppm) is coupled to two other H atoms, which must be H^22 and H^3, with resonances at 3.2 and 4.3 ppm. Of those two, only the one at 4.3 ppm couples to the peak at 1.3 ppm, so H^4 must be at 1.3 ppm, and H^3 must be at 4.3 ppm. The NOESY spectrum shows crosspeaks connecting H^3 to both H^4 and H^22, but not to H^21, so H^3 and H^4 both point into the plane of the screen.
evalFeedback	7	2	The NOESY spectrum shows crosspeaks connecting H^3 to both H^4 and H^22. If H^3 were coming out of the plane of the screen, H^3 would connect to H^21, not H^22.
evalFeedback	7	3	What does the NOESY show should be the relative orientation of H^3 and H^4?

evalFeedback	9	1	The two compounds differ only in whether C^5 is attached to O^4 or O^2. HMBC is the best method to differentiate them. Identify the resonance of C^5 by its chemical shift (around 100 ppm), and identify the resonances of the two H^4 in the HSQC (they are diastereotopic) by the fact that they are the only CH2 group in the compound (two H resonances correlating to single C resonance). Then look for an interaction between C^5 and either H^4 in the HMBC spectrum. If you see one, you have the compound on the left; if you do not, it is the compound on the right.

Then use NOESY to look for an interaction between H^6 and either H^10. If you see such an interaction, you have the compound on the right; otherwise, you have the compound on the left. (In this case, an absence of a NOESY interaction can be interpreted with confidence because the compound is so rigid.)

If they are coupled to one another with a J value of 12 Hz or more, the compound is trans; otherwise, it is cis. One could also use NOESY to look for interactions between H^4 (doublet integrating to 3 H around 2.0 ppm) and the two alkene H atoms; if you observe interactions to both alkene H atoms, you have the compound on the left, whereas if you observe an interaction with only one alkene H atom, you have the compound on the right.

Identify C^1 and C^2 in the HSQC by the number of H atoms attached to each (1 or 2), and then identify H^1 and the two H^2. (The two H^2 are diastereotopic.) If you have the compound on the left, you should see a significant 3-bond coupling constant between P and the two H^2, making them both a ddd, but leaving H^1 as a dd, whereas if you have the compound on the right, you should see a significant 3-bond coupling constant between P and H^1, making it a ddd, but leaving both H^1 as dd.
qStmt	13		A new compound was isolated from a Chinese shrub, and its structure was determined to be one of the two C(7) diastereomers in Figures 1 and 2 (exo and endo, respectively). The authors of the paper decided that the compound had to be the exo isomer (FIgure 1), because in the NOESY spectrum of the compound, they saw a correlation from one of the H(26) to a CH3 singlet (H(27) or H(28)), and from the same CH3 singlet to H(5). Is the authors' conclusion supported by the evidence? Explain your answer.
evalFeedback	13	1	The given data are consistent with either isomer. In the exo isomer, H^5 and C^^26 are both equatorial, so H^5 and H^^26 will interact with both the neighboring axial and equatorial Me groups. In the endo isomer, C^^26 is axial, but its H atoms will still interact with the H atoms of the equatorial Me group, which will interact still with H^5.

evalFeedback	1	14	Good!  This reaction proceeds by the S<sub>RN</sub>1 mechanism.  After initial electron transfer from PhS^- to the Br atom to give a radical anion, Br^- leaves, the PhS^- attacks the nascent C radical to give a new radical anion, and this compound transfers its electron back to another equivalent of the starting material to give the product and the first radical anion, which continues the chain.

If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

evalFeedback	3	13	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	3	14	A &sigma;-bond metathesis, in which the groups attached to two atoms swap places in a single step, does not occur in this reaction.

evalFeedback	4	9	In the presence of the strong base CH3Li, a free carbene, which is a strong electrophile, does not form.  The second equivalent of CH3Li intervenes to divert the carbene's precursor away from the carbene and toward a different reactive intermediate.

evalFeedback	5	9	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  The product does not incorporate the elements of H2O, so what is the reactivity of HO^- in this reaction?  With which atom near the reaction centers can it react in this way?

evalFeedback	5	15	Mechanistic steps that involve three or more separate molecules coming together to react are exceedingly rare.  Try rewriting your mechanism so that it involves only pairs of molecules reacting in each step.
evalFeedback	5	16	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.

evalFeedback	7	3	You have drawn an <small>L</small>-aldohexose, not a <small>D</small>-aldohexose.  The designation as <small>L</small> or <small>D</small> is determined by the configuration at C^5 (S or R, respectively).

evalFeedback	9	2	Good!  HCN adds to the C=O #pi bond.  Two compounds that differ in the configuration of the new stereocenter are obtained.  The preexisting stereocenter remains unchanged.

evalFeedback	1	1	The specified product  is not produced in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please use all three provided starting materials in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	3	There are no radicals in the mechanism of this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	4	In the presence of the strong acid HCl, no bases should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 10.
evalFeedback	1	5	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What is the role of H^+ in this reaction?  With which atom in the substrate will it react?
evalFeedback	1	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  After protonation, this compound rearranges ( tautomerization) to another compound. Please draw this new compound.
evalFeedback	1	7	Some of your electron-flow arrows are incorrect.  If one of the boxes is colored red, the electron-flow arrows in that box probably do not lead to the compounds in the subsequent box.
evalFeedback	1	8	At least one of the starting materials in your mechanism is not among the starting materials that are given for this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	9	Substitution reactions at C rarely occur by the SN2 mechanism under acidic conditions.  What other mechanism is more likely to be operative?
evalFeedback	1	10	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.  You can achieve the same result with fewer electron-flow arrows.
evalFeedback	1	11	Your mechanism is mostly correct, but boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	1	12	Your mechanism is mostly correct, but boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.
evalFeedback	1	13	It is considered bad practice to draw a four-centered transition state for a proton transfer reaction.  Either split it up into two steps, or use CH3OH to simultaneously protonate one O and deprotonate the other.
evalFeedback	1	14	Your mechanism appears to be correct!
Topic: Carbonyl compounds; Set: Additions to carbonyls
header			Give the major product of the following reaction (after aqueous workup).  If no reaction occurs, draw the starting material.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  An aldehyde will convert to an acetal in the presence of an excess of alcohol and catalytic acid.
evalFeedback	1	2	This compound, a hemiacetal, is in equilibrium with the starting material, but it is not a stable product. Hemiacetals react further with alcohols to give what kind of products? 
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	1	5	When the nucleophilic O of EtOH reacts with an electrophilic atom, the O-H bonds are replaced by a bond between O and the electrophilic atom, so the product has no OH groups.
evalFeedback	1	6	The O of the carbonyl group leaves as water, so there is no OH group attached to the three-carbon chain in the product.
evalFeedback	1	7	The C-C and C-H bonds of the starting material remain unchanged.  All the chemistry occurs at the C=O bond.
evalFeedback	1	8	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	9	The product no longer has a carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	1	10	The product contains two O atoms.
evalFeedback	1	11	Two equivalents of EtOH are incorporated into the product.  How many C atoms should the product have?
evalFeedback	1	12	The product contains no rings or #pi bonds.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  A C=N bond replaces the C=O bond, and H2O is lost.  The preferred geometry about the C=N bond (which has E/Z stereoisomerism, like C=C double bonds) is to have the NH2 group E to the large Ph group.
evalFeedback	2	2	You're close.  The only error in your answer is a stereochemical detail.  The C=N bond displays E/Z stereochemistry like a C=C bond does.  The two groups attached to the N of the C=N bond are NH2 and a lone pair.  Which is larger?  Which would rather be E to the large Ph group?
evalFeedback	2	3	Clever answer, but not correct. Aminals such as these are not very stable. The product should have a C=N double bond.
evalFeedback	2	4	This compound is obtained as an unstable intermediate, but it loses the elements of H2O to give the product.
evalFeedback	2	5	The compound you have drawn is called an enamine.  Enamines are not stable compounds.  They much prefer having a C=N bond to having a C=C bond.
evalFeedback	2	6	This compound is obtained only in the presence of HO(-) and much heating. In their absence, a different compound is obtained.
evalFeedback	2	7	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	8	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	2	9	The N-N bond does not cleave in this reaction.

evalFeedback	2	12	The product contains the two N atoms from hydrazine.
evalFeedback	2	13	A new ring does not form in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  After hydrazone formation, the HO^- promotes elimination of N2 to give the alkane.
evalFeedback	3	2	This compound, a hydrazone, is obtained in the absence of HO^- and heat. In their presence, it reacts further to give a different compound.
evalFeedback	3	3	This compound, a hemiaminal, is in equilibrium with the starting materials, but it is not a stable product, especially in the presence of HO(-) and heat.
evalFeedback	3	4	If this were the product, what would be the purpose of hydrazine?
evalFeedback	3	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	6	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	3	7	The C skeleton and C-H bonds of the starting material remain in the product.
evalFeedback	3	8	The number of rings does not change in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	9	In the first step of this reaction, the O atom of the substrate is lost.  In the second step, the HO^- acts as a base, not a nucleophile, so it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	10	The two N atoms of NH2NH2 are lost as N2 in the second step of the reaction.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  NaBH4 is a source of nucleophilic H^-.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	4	7	The C-C and C-H bonds of the starting material remain in the product.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The ^-C#tripleN attacks the carbonyl C, and workup protonates the O^- to give the cyanohydrin.
evalFeedback	5	2	Carbonyl compounds react with only one equivalent of NC(-).
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	5	After aqueous workup, the Na atom is replaced with a H atom.
evalFeedback	5	6	HCl serves merely as an acid.  The Cl atom is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	7	C#tripleN is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	8	The product retains the single O atom of the starting material.
evalFeedback	5	9	The C atom of the NaCN is nucleophilic.  It attacks the electrophilic atom in the organic substrate.
evalFeedback	5	10	What functional group is formed when you treat a carbonyl compound with a C nucleophile?
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  LiAlH4 is a source of nucleophilic H^-.  Attack of H^- on the carbonyl C, loss of the EtO^- group with re-formation of the C=O bond, and attack of another H^- on the carbonyl C provides the alkoxide, which is protonated upon workup to give the alcohol.
evalFeedback	6	2	This aldehyde is an intermediate, but it is even more reactive toward LiAlH4 than the starting material, so it reacts further.
evalFeedback	6	3	Hemiacetals are not stable compounds.  They convert immediately to aldehydes.  What would happen to an aldehyde under these reaction conditions?
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	5	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	6	6	LiAlH4 is a source of nucleophilic H^-.  After workup, neither Li nor Al is present in the organic product.
evalFeedback	6	7	The product retains an O atom.
evalFeedback	6	8	LiAlH4 reduces all carbonyl groups, so the product will not have one.
evalFeedback	6	9	The C-C and C-H bonds of the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	6	10	The OEt group acts as a leaving group in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The carbonyl group reacts with the two OH groups to make an acetal (ketal), in this case a cyclic one.
evalFeedback	7	2	This compound, a hemiacetal, is in equilibrium with the starting material, but it is not a stable product. Hemiacetals react further with alcohols to give what kind of product?
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	Both OH groups of the 1,2-diol react with electrophilic atom(s).  When they do so, the O-H bonds are replaced by bonds between O and the electrophile, so the product has no OH groups.
evalFeedback	7	6	Both the starting materials are incorporated into the product, and their C-C and C-H bonds remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	7	7	When a 1,2-diol is combined with a ketone or aldehyde, the product usually has a ring.
evalFeedback	7	8	The by-product of this reaction is H2O.  How many O atoms should your product have?
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  The ^-C#tripleN group adds to the electrophilic #b C atom of the #a, #b-unsaturated ketone.
evalFeedback	8	2	The starting material is electrophilic in two different places: at the carbonyl group, and at another location.  The major product is derived from addition of ^-C#tripleN to the other location.  Draw a few resonance structures of the starting material to find out where else it is electrophilic.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	8	5	The Na atom is replaced with H upon aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	8	6	The C#tripleN group is incorporated into the product.  It is attached through the C atom.
evalFeedback	8	7	The product retains the O atom.
evalFeedback	8	8	Your answer contains an enol.  Enols quickly tautomerize to the corresponding ketones.
evalFeedback	8	9	The ketone of the starting material is retained in the product.  Ketones are electrophilic, so you might expect this one to react with NaCN, but the reagent reacts with another part of the molecule that is also electrophilic.
evalFeedback	8	10	All of the #sigma bonds of the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	8	11	You're warm.  Draw a resonance structure of the C=C-C=O group in the starting material to see which C atom of the alkene is the electrophilic one.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  In this reductive amination reaction, NH3 reversibly combines with the ketone to give the imine PhC(=NH)Et, and catalytic hydrogenation gives the primary amine PhCH(NH2)Et.
evalFeedback	9	2	This is a perfectly reasonable answer. How much is obtained would depend on the amount of NH3 used. Assume, though, that a large excess of NH3 is used.
evalFeedback	9	3	Clever answer, but not correct. Aminals such as these are not very stable. Besides, what would be the purpose of the H2 and Pt?
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	6	Pt catalyzes the hydrogenation of an unsaturated intermediate.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	9	7	The product contains N from the NH3.
evalFeedback	9	8	When a ketone is mixed with NH3, the elements of H2O are lost, so the product contains no O.
evalFeedback	9	9	Yes, an intermediate has a C=N bond, but it is reduced by the H2 over Pt that is also present in the reaction mixture.
evalFeedback	9	10	The C-C and C-H bonds of the starting material are retained unchanged in the product.
evalFeedback	9	11	Only a single N atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	12	The product has no more rings than the starting material.
qStmt	10		There are two products of this reaction.  Draw the one that contains the five-membered ring.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  In this Wittig reaction, the organic fragment attached to Ph3P replaces the O atom in the ketone, and the O is attached to the Ph3P.
evalFeedback	10	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	3	Please draw a single product that contains a five-membered ring.
evalFeedback	10	4	The P atom is not incorporated into the product that contains the five-membered ring.
evalFeedback	10	5	The Ph groups remain attached to the P atom.  They are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	10	6	All of the C-C and C-H bonds of the starting materials remain unchanged in the reaction.
evalFeedback	10	7	The P-O bond is extremely strong, so the O ends up incorporated into the P-containing product, not the one you are asked to draw here.
evalFeedback	10	8	The number of C and H atoms in the product should equal the number of C and H atoms in the two starting materials (excluding those in the Ph groups).
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  A C=N bond replaces the C=O bond, and H2O is lost.
evalFeedback	11	2	Clever answer, but not correct. Aminals such as these are not very stable. The product incorporates only one equivalent of starting material.
evalFeedback	11	3	This hemiaminal is obtained initially, but it is not stable.  It reacts further to give a different product.  What small molecule can be lost from this compound?
evalFeedback	11	4	Enamines such as this one are not very stable compounds.  They would much rather have a C=N #pi bond than a C=C #pi bond.
evalFeedback	11	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	11	6	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	11	7	The product contains one N atom from methylamine.
evalFeedback	11	8	The final product should have as many C atoms as starting materials have.

evalFeedback	11	12	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	11	13	The number of rings and #pi bonds in the product remains unchanged from the starting material.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  A ketone will convert to an acetal in the presence of an excess of alcohol and catalytic acid.

evalFeedback	12	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	12	4	Please draw a single molecule.

evalFeedback	12	7	When the nucleophilic O of MeOH reacts with an electrophilic atom, the O-H bonds are replaced by a bond between O and the electrophilic atom, so the product has no OH groups.

evalFeedback	13	8	Which is more nucleophilic, N or O?  Which will attack the carbonyl group?
evalFeedback	13	9	The number of rings remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	13	10	H2O is lost in this reaction, and H2NOH is incorporated into the product, so the number of O atoms remains unchanged.

evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  The ketone reacts with the diol under acidic conditions to make an acetal (ketal), in this case a cyclic one.

evalFeedback	14	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	14	5	Both OH groups of the 1,2-diol react with electrophilic atom(s).  When they do so, the O-H bonds are replaced by bonds between O and the electrophile, so the product has no OH groups.
evalFeedback	14	6	Both the starting materials are incorporated into the product, and their C-C and C-H bonds remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	14	7	When a 1,2-diol is combined with a ketone or aldehyde, the product usually has a ring. The starting material has already a ring, so the product will have a total of how many rings?
evalFeedback	14	8	The by-product of this reaction is H2O.  How many O atoms should your product have?
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  A C=N bond replaces the C=O bond, and H2O is lost.
evalFeedback	15	2	Clever answer, but not correct. Aminals such as these are not very stable. The product should have a C=N double bond.
evalFeedback	15	3	This compound is obtained as an unstable intermediate.  What product can be obtained by loss of a small molecule?
evalFeedback	15	4	Enamines such as this one much prefer to have a C=N #pi bond instead of a C=C #pi bond.

evalFeedback	21	4	The P atom is not incorporated into the product that contains the nonaromatic six-membered ring.

evalFeedback	21	6	All of the C-C and C-H bonds of the starting materials remain unchanged in the reaction.
evalFeedback	21	7	The P-O bond is extremely strong, so the O ends up incorporated into the P-containing product, not the one you are asked to draw here.
evalFeedback	21	8	The number of C and H atoms in the product should equal the number of C and H atoms in the two starting materials (excluding those in the Ph groups).

evalFeedback	24	2	Clever answer, but not correct. Aminals such as these are not very stable. Only one equivalent of semicarbazide reacts with the aldehyde.

evalFeedback	25	4	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	25	5	When the nucleophilic O of EtOH reacts with an electrophilic atom, the O-H bonds are replaced by a bond between O and the electrophilic atom, so the product has no OH groups.

evalFeedback	25	7	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	25	8	When the nucleophilic O of EtOH reacts with an electrophilic atom, the O-H bonds are replaced by a bond between O and the electrophilic atom, so the product has no OH groups.

evalFeedback	26	7	When a 1,3-dithiol is combined with a ketone or aldehyde, the product has a new ring.
evalFeedback	26	8	The O atom is converted to a good leaving group, so the product will not contain an O atom.
evalFeedback	26	9	The product no longer has a carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	26	10	Both S atoms of the starting dithiol are incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	26	11	When these two compounds are combined, a new ring is obtained.  Both S atoms are nucleophilic, so they both must attack an electrophilic atom.  What small molecule must be lost to give the product?

evalFeedback	3	5	Only one equivalent of EtSH is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	6	The S-H bond in EtSH will be <i>replaced</i> by a bond between S and an electrophilic atom, so the product will not have an SH group.
evalFeedback	3	7	Enols rapidly tautomerize to the corresponding carbonyl compounds.
evalFeedback	3	8	There is an electrophilic atom in the starting material other than the carbonyl C with which the soft S nucleophile would prefer to react.

Topic: Carbonyl compounds; Set: Spectroscopy problems
qStmt	1		A compound of formula C6H10O2 shows only two absorptions in the ^1H NMR spectrum: a singlet at 2.67 ppm and a singlet at 2.15 ppm. These absorptions have areas in the ratio 2:3. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorption at 1708 cm^^-1 . Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	1	1	Very good! The IR absorption at 1708 cm^^-1 suggests a ketone. The formula indicates two degrees of unsaturation.  The NMR singlets in the ratio of 2:3 indicate a highly symmetric molecule.  The lack of a resonance downfield of 3 ppm suggests that the compound is not a cyclic ether or alcohol, so both O atoms are probably part of ketones.  The singlet at 2.15 ppm is from the CH3 groups, and the singlet at 2.67 ppm is from the CH2 groups.
evalFeedback	1	2	What functional group has an absorption around 1700 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	1	3	Your structure does not have the indicated molecular formula C6H10O2.
evalFeedback	1	4	Knowing that a ketone is present in your molecule and also that in NMR there is a singlet at 2.67 ppm, what group do you think is bonded to the carbonyl group?
evalFeedback	1	5	Your structure does not match the NMR peaks indicated in the problem. Try again.
qStmt	2		The H and C NMR spectra of a compound of formula C10H12O appear below. This compound reacts with an acidic solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to give a crystalline derivative, but it gives a negative Tollens test. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The functional group tests indicate the compound is a ketone, and the NMR spectra indicate it has a monosubstituted benzene ring.  Only 1-phenyl-2-butanone matches the H NMR spectra perfectly.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your structure doesn't have the molecular formula C10H12O as indicated.
evalFeedback	2	3	Aldehydes give a positive Tollens test, so your structure shouldn't include an aldehyde group.
evalFeedback	2	4	What functional group would react with an acidic solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to give a crystalline derivative?  Note the C NMR resonance at about 210 ppm.
evalFeedback	2	5	What functional group is responsible for the NMR resonances around 7.3 ppm?
evalFeedback	2	6	What does the integration and multiplicity pattern of the resonances at 7.3 ppm tell you about the substitution level of the aromatic ring?
evalFeedback	2	7	The compound you have drawn would have a singlet and two triplets, but the NMR spectrum has a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet.
evalFeedback	2	8	You're on the right track, but the compound you drew does not have the indicated NMR spectra.  You need to rearrange the atoms in the side chain.
qStmt	3		An unknown compound gives a molecular ion of <i>m/z</i> 70 in the mass spectrum. It reacts with semicarbazide hydrochloride to give a crystalline derivative, but it gives a negative Tollens test. The NMR and IR spectra appear below. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right! A solid semicarbazone derivative and a negative Tollens test indicate a ketone. The molecular formula is C4H6O, indicating two degrees of unsaturation. The IR shows a strong peak at 1790 cm^^-1 , indicative of a ketone in a small ring.   The 2:1 integration ratio in the NMR spectrum proves that the compound must be cyclobutanone.
evalFeedback	3	2	This compound would show a 3H doublet in the NMR spectrum for the Me group. But you are correct that the compound must contain a ketone in a small ring.
evalFeedback	3	3	The MS shows an ion at <i>m/z</i> 70.
evalFeedback	3	4	Aldehydes give a positive Tollens test.
evalFeedback	3	5	What functional group would react with semicarbazide hydrochloride to give a crystalline derivative?
evalFeedback	3	6	Neither the IR spectrum (1650-1650 cm^^-1 ) nor the NMR spectrum (5-6 ppm) indicates the presence of a double bond.
evalFeedback	3	7	Your structure does not match the indicated IR and NMR spectra. Try again.
qStmt	4		The UV spectrum of an unknown compound shows values of &lambda;<sub>max</sub> at 225 nm (&epsilon; = 10000) and at 318 nm (&epsilon; = 40). The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 96 and a prominent base peak at <i>m/z</i> 68. The IR and NMR spectra appear below. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct! The IR shows a strong conjugated carbonyl at 1690 cm^^-1 and a small alkene at 1610 cm^^-1 . The absence of peaks at 2700-2800 cm^^-1 shows that no aldehyde is present. The NMR shows two vinyl H's. No methyls are apparent in the NMR, so the 6H group of peaks at 2.0-2.4 ppm is 3 CH2 groups.
evalFeedback	4	2	The MS shows the molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 96.
evalFeedback	4	3	Aldehydes show a small peak at 2700-2800 cm^^-1 . This peak is not present in the indicated IR spectrum, so no aldehyde group should be present in your structure.
evalFeedback	4	4	What functional group is responsible for the IR absorption at 1690 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	4	5	What functional group is responsible for the C NMR resonance at almost 200 ppm?
evalFeedback	4	6	What functional group is responsible for the IR absorption at 1610 cm^^-1 , the C NMR absorptions at 120-160 ppm, and the H NMR absorptions at 6-7 ppm?
evalFeedback	4	7	If a methyl group were present, a 3H absorbance would be observed in the H NMR spectrum, and one is not.
evalFeedback	4	8	The strong #pi to #pi* absorption at 225 nm in UV spectrum suggests a conjugated ketone. This is confirmed by IR: a strong, conjugated carbonyl group at 1690 cm^^-1 is present.
evalFeedback	4	9	Your structure does not match the indicated IR and NMR spectra. Try again.
qStmt	5		The mass spectrum of unknown compound <b>A</b> shows a molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 116 and prominent peaks at <i>m/z</i> 87 and <i>m/z</i> 101. Its UV spectrum shows no maximum above 200 nm. The IR and NMR spectra of <b>A</b> are shown below. When <b>A</b> is washed with dilute aqueous acid, extracted into dichloromethane, and the solvent evaporated, the product <b>B</b> shows a strong carbonyl signal at 1715 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum and a weak maximum at 274 nm (&epsilon; = 16) in the UV spectrum. Determine the structure of <b>A</b>.
evalFeedback	5	1	Very good! This molecule has a molecular formula of C6H12O2 with molecular weight of 116. The IR shows no alkene and no carbonyl; after acid hydrolysis a ketone is formed which shows a strong signal at 1715 cm^^-1 . The NMR shows a singlet for 3H (methyl group), a quartet (1.6 ppm, 2H) and a triplet (0.9 ppm, 3H) corresponding to the ethyl group. The two CH2 groups show a singlet at 3.9 ppm for 4H's.
evalFeedback	5	2	The MS shows the molecular ion of <b>A</b> at <i>m/z</i> 116.
evalFeedback	5	3	The IR spectrum shows no signal (around 1700 cm^^-1 ) for a carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	5	4	If <b>A</b> were an alcohol, it would show a strong IR absorbance at about 3500 cm^^-1 .
evalFeedback	5	5	Neither the C NMR nor the H NMR spectrum shows any indication of an alkene being present.  (The resonance at 110 ppm in the C NMR spectrum is not due to an alkene.)
evalFeedback	5	6	<b>B</b> is obviously a ketone. What functional group gives, by hydrolysis, a ketone?  Hint: This functional group gives rise to the C NMR resonance at 110 ppm.
evalFeedback	5	7	If this were the structure, the singlet for the CH3 group and the quartet for the CH2 of the Et group would appear much further downfield.  Try rearranging the hydrocarbon around the O-C-O core.
evalFeedback	5	8	Your structure does not match the indicated IR and NMR spectra.

The reaction conditions are acidic, so SN2 substitution is unlikely to occur, and SN1 substitution would also be unlikely to occur because the C(4) and C(6) OH groups would inductively destabilize the C(5) carbocation.  For these reasons, the C(5)-O bond is unlikely to cleave in this reaction, so there is no reason to protonate the C(5) OH group.

Topic: Carbonyl compounds; Set: Retrosynthesis of carbonyl cpds
qStmt	1		Draw all of the different ketones from which the alcohol shown below can be prepared by a Grignard addition.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  Each ketone is retrosynthetically derived from the alcohol by disconnecting a bond between the alcohol C and a neighboring C atom.
evalFeedback	1	2	You have drawn too many compounds.  Either you have drawn some more than once, or you have drawn some that are not ketones, or you have drawn some that cannot be used to prepare the alcohol shown.
evalFeedback	1	3	None of the starting materials should contain an alcohol functional group.  All should be ketones.
evalFeedback	1	4	None of the starting materials should contain an ester functional group.  All should be ketones.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw ketones.
evalFeedback	1	6	What about the ketone obtained by disconnecting the CH3 group from the alcohol C?
evalFeedback	1	7	What about the ketone obtained by disconnecting the CH2CH3 group from the alcohol C?
evalFeedback	1	8	What about the ketone obtained by disconnecting the Ph group from the alcohol C?
qStmt	2		Draw all of the different aldehydes from which the alcohol shown below can be prepared by a Grignard addition.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  Each aldehyde is retrosynthetically derived from the alcohol by disconnecting a bond between the alcohol C and a neighboring C atom.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your answer contains the ketone 1-cyclohexyl-2-methyl-1-propanone.  Although reduction of this compound with NaBH4 or LiAlH4 would indeed give the desired alcohol, it is an incorrect answer for two reasons: (1) you were asked to draw aldehydes, and it is a ketone; and, (2) reduction with NaBH4 or LiAlH4 is not a Grignard addition reaction.
evalFeedback	2	3	You have drawn too many compounds.  Either you have drawn some more than once, or you have drawn some that are not aldehydes, or you have drawn some that cannot be used to prepare the alcohol shown.
evalFeedback	2	4	None of the starting materials should contain an alcohol functional group.  All should be aldehydes.
evalFeedback	2	5	None of the starting materials should contain an ester functional group.  All should be aldehydes.
evalFeedback	2	6	None of the starting materials should contain a ketone functional group.  All should be aldehydes.

evalFeedback	2	9	What about the aldehyde obtained by disconnecting the cyclohexyl group from the alcohol C?
qStmt	3		Draw the starting material from which the compound below is best prepared.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  The best bond to disconnect is the one between the alcohol C and the C of the CN group.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	3	4	The best bond to disconnect is the one between C(sp) and C(sp3).
evalFeedback	3	5	When disconnecting a bond between C(sp) and C(sp3), if C(sp3) bears an OH group, the best starting material is not an alkyl halide.  What functional group should it contain instead?
evalFeedback	3	6	Except for the bond between C(sp3) and C(sp), all of the C-C and C-H bonds in the target are present in the starting material.
qStmt	4		Draw the ester from which the compound below is best prepared.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  An alcohol with two identical groups attached to the alcohol C can be disconnected at those bonds, and the alcohol C is retrosynthetically converted to the carbonyl C of an ester group.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	4	4	You haven't drawn an ester.
evalFeedback	4	5	It is true that any alcohol can be made from an ester in which the alcohol O is attached to a carbonyl group.  However, that's not the answer we're looking for here.  The alcohol can be made from an ester that does not already contain all of the C atoms of the alcohol.
evalFeedback	4	6	An alcohol is retrosynthetically converted to an ester by disconnecting two identical groups attached to the alcohol C.  The alcohol C becomes the carbonyl C in the ester.
qStmt	5		Draw the starting material from which the compound below is best prepared.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  The best bond to disconnect is between C(sp) and C(sp3).  Because the C(sp3) bears an OH group, it becomes a carbonyl C in the starting material.

evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	5	4	In a compound that contains an alkyne, which bond is best to disconnect?

qStmt	6		Draw the ester from which the compound below is best prepared.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  A primary alcohol is best made from an ester in which the carbonyl C is derived from the alcohol C.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	6	4	You haven't drawn an ester.
evalFeedback	6	5	It is true that any alcohol can be made from an ester in which the alcohol O is attached to a carbonyl group.  However, that's not the answer we're looking for here.  The alcohol can be made from an ester that does not already contain all of the atoms of the alcohol.
evalFeedback	6	6	An alcohol is retrosynthetically converted to an ester by disconnecting two identical groups attached to the alcohol C.  The alcohol C becomes the carbonyl C in the ester.
qStmt	7		The diol shown below can be prepared from a lactone (a cyclic ester).  Draw the lactone.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The primary alcohol C becomes the ester carbonyl C, and the secondary alcohol O joins up to it.
evalFeedback	7	2	Please indicate the proper relative stereochemistry, which does not change between starting material and target.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	7	5	You haven't drawn an ester.
evalFeedback	7	6	Retrosynthetically, the formation of the lactone from the diol requires the creation of one new ring in the compound.  The alcohol that is not retrosynthetically converted to the ester has its O join up with the carbonyl C.
evalFeedback	7	7	The number of C atoms doesn't change when one converts the diol to the precursor lactone.
evalFeedback	7	8	An alcohol is retrosynthetically converted to an ester by disconnecting two identical groups attached to the alcohol C.  The alcohol C becomes the carbonyl C in the ester.
qStmt	8		Draw the Wittig reagent and the carbonyl compound from which the compound below is best prepared.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  Disconnect the C=C bond, add =O to the former alkene C on the more substituted side to get the ketone, and add Ph3P= to the former alkene C on the less substituted side to get the Wittig reagent.
evalFeedback	8	2	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw only two starting materials.
evalFeedback	8	4	When disconnecting the C=C bond, it is better to convert the <i>more</i> substituted alkene C into the carbonyl C.
evalFeedback	8	5	Neither starting material contains an alkene.  The C=C bond is disconnected.
evalFeedback	8	6	Only the C=C bond of the starting material is disconnected.  The other C-C and C-H bonds remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	7	A Wittig reagent has the structure Ph3P=CR2.
evalFeedback	8	8	In a Wittig reaction, one of the starting materials is always an aldehyde or ketone.
Topic: Carbonyl compounds; Set: Multistep synthesis
qStmt	1		Design a synthesis of the following compound.  You may use as starting materials, (1) any <i>esters</i>, or (2) any compounds that contain up to <b>two contiguous C atoms</b> and are <b>uncharged and free of alkali and alkaline earth metals</b>, or (3) any compounds in the reaction conditions menu.
evalFeedback	1	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	1	2	Note that two of the groups attached to the alcohol C are identical.  What is the best disconnection in this circumstance?
evalFeedback	1	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	1	5	Your synthesis is not unreasonable, but it has too many steps.  There is a more efficient route.
evalFeedback	1	6	Good!  One approach: The tertiary alcohol with two identical groups attached to the alcohol C can be made by addition of <i>n</i>-BuMgBr to ethyl 3-methylbutanoate.  The Grignard reagent can be made from ethyl butanoate by reduction with LiAlH4, conversion to the bromide with PBr3, and addition of Mg.
qStmt	2		Design a synthesis of the following compound from  any compounds containing up to three contiguous C atoms.
evalFeedback	2	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	2	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	2	4	Good!  Disconnecting either C-C bond involving the alcohol C gives a 3-carbon piece and a 4-carbon piece.  If the 4-carbon piece is an aldehyde, one approach is to make it by reduction of a nitrile, which can be made by an SN2 reaction of ^-CN.
qStmt	3		Design a synthesis of the following compound in which all C atoms derive from benzonitrile (PhCN).
evalFeedback	3	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	3	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	3	4	Good!  It makes most sense to disconnect the carbonyl-CH2 bond.  This bond can be made by addition of a Grignard reagent to PhCN.  The Grignard reagent can be made from the alcohol, which can be made from the aldehyde, which can be made from the nitrile.
qStmt	4		Design a synthesis of 2,5-hexanedione from ethyl 4-oxopentanoate (ethyl levulinate), as shown, and any other starting materials (other than those chosen from the menu) containing no more than 1 contiguous C atom.
evalFeedback	4	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	4	4	Good!  Before the ester can be converted into a ketone, the existing ketone must be protected as the acetal.  The ester can be converted into a ketone by addition of CH3^- to the corresponding Weinreb amide or the corresponding aldehyde.  Deprotection of the acetal is the last step.
qStmt	5		Design a synthesis of the following compound from starting materials containing no more than three C atoms (other than those from the menu).
evalFeedback	5	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	5	2	What is the best way to prepare an alkene when E1 or E2 elimination would give you a mixture of regioisomers?
evalFeedback	5	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	5	5	It's much better to do the final Wittig reaction between a ketone and a monosubstituted Wittig reagent, rather than between an aldehyde and a disubstituted Wittig reagent.
evalFeedback	5	7	Good!  The alkene is best made by a Wittig reaction between 3-hexanone and Ph3P=CHCH2CH3.  The former can be made by addition of PrMgBr to CH3CH2CHO followed by oxidation; the latter can be made from Ph3P and PrBr.
qStmt	6		Design a synthesis of the compound shown from neutral, metal-free starting materials containing no more than three total C atoms (other than those from the menu).
evalFeedback	6	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	6	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	6	4	Good!
qStmt	7		Design a synthesis of the compound shown from starting materials containing only C and H and any other starting materials containing 0 carbon atoms.  (You may use any reagents from the menu.)
evalFeedback	7	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	7	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	7	4	Good!
qStmt	8		Design a synthesis of the given target from <b>benzene</b> and any other <b>uncharged, metal-free</b> starting materials containing <b>up to five contiguous C atoms</b>.
evalFeedback	8	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	8	3	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	8	4	Your synthesis will work, but it has too many steps. There is a more efficient route.
evalFeedback	8	5	Good! The shortest route is to do a Friedel-Crafts acylation between benzene and a five-carbon acyl chloride to make a ketone, then to add a Grignard reagent to make the tertiary alcohol.

qStmt	4		ethylene ketal of 3-hexanone
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  An ethylene ketal has a five-membered ring with two O atoms in the 1 and 3 positions, and the C that is attached to both O atoms is derived from the carbonyl C.
evalFeedback	4	2	A ketal of a ketone does not contain a ketone group.  The ketal contains all the C-C and C-H bonds of the ketone but lacks the carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	4	3	What is the structure of a ketal?
evalFeedback	4	4	Despite the name, no alkene is present in this compound.  The word "ethylene" refers to the formula of the portion of the molecule connecting two O atoms.
evalFeedback	4	5	The compound contains all of the C-C and C-H bonds of 3-hexanone and ethylene but replaces the C=O bond of the ketone with other bonds to heteroatoms.
evalFeedback	4	6	The words "ethylene ketal" suggest that the compound is derived from the reaction of ethylene glycol with the ketone, with loss of H2O.  The structure of ethylene glycol should be retained in the compound.
evalFeedback	4	7	An ethylene ketal is derived from ethylene glycol (1,2-ethanediol) making bonds from both of its O atoms to a carbonyl C.  As a result, the ketal has one more ring than the starting material.
evalFeedback	4	8	This compound is formed from equal parts 1,2-ethanediol and 3-hexanone, and H2O is lost.

Topic: Carbonyl reactions at the &alpha;-carbon; Set: Alkylations, condensations, etc.
header			Give the major product of the reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  In the first step, a Dieckmann reaction makes a bond between the #a-carbon of one ester and the carbonyl C of the other, giving a #b-keto ester.  In the second step, hydrolysis and decarboxylation gives the ketone.
evalFeedback	1	2	This compound is the product after step (1). What is the product after step (2)?
evalFeedback	1	3	This compound is an intermediate in step (2). What happens when it is heated?
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	6	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	1	7	When a starting material has two functional groups, you need to think about an intramolecular reaction that can form a cyclic product.
evalFeedback	1	8	Your answer contains a hemiacetal.  Hemiacetals are inherently unstable, converting to ketones.
evalFeedback	1	9	An acetal wouldn't form under these reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	1	10	An ester would be converted into what functional group with hot aqueous acid (step 2)?
evalFeedback	1	11	Step 2 generates a carboxylic acid, but decarboxylation occurs subsequently.
evalFeedback	1	12	An ether is formed from an alkoxide and an alkyl halide, so an ether cannot be formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	13	The only electrophile in the molecule is a carbonyl C.  In step 1, a nucleophilic C attacks this electrophile and expels EtO^-, leaving behind what functional group?
evalFeedback	1	14	An intramolecular C-C bond-forming reaction occurs under these conditions.  What nucleophilic C can combine with an electrophilic C to form a ring?
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  In the first step, the PBr3 converts the acid into an acyl bromide.  The acyl bromide then reacts with Br2 at the #a-carbon.  In the second step, the acyl bromide is hydrolyzed back to an acid, leaving the Br atom on the #a-carbon.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	4	Although a short-lived intermediate in this reaction contains P, the final organic product does not contain any P.
evalFeedback	2	5	The number of C atoms remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	2	6	Look at the reagents.  What element should your product contain?
evalFeedback	2	7	Acyl bromides are very reactive toward water, so an acyl bromide won't survive step 2.
evalFeedback	2	8	Step 1 converts the CO2H group to an acyl bromide (among other things), but step 2 converts the acyl bromide back to a carboxylic acid.
evalFeedback	2	9	Only one equivalent of Br2 is used, and the #a-position is much less reactive after it has already been brominated once.
evalFeedback	2	10	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	11	The product should not contain an alcohol.
evalFeedback	2	12	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	2	13	Br2 is electrophilic.  Which C atom of the starting material can be nucleophilic?
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  A Dieckmann reaction occurs between the nucleophilic C next to a CO2Et group and an electrophilic C of a carbonyl group.  Because the CO2Et groups differ, there is a choice of which #a-carbon to deprotonate.  The product is derived from deprotonation of the methylene, not the methine, because deprotonation of the methylene gives a Dieckmann product that can be deprotonated (the thermodynamic driving force).
evalFeedback	3	2	An ester with a single H on the #a-carbon can only be an electrophile, not a nucleophile, in a Dieckmann reaction.
evalFeedback	3	3	This would be the answer if step 2 had boiling aqueous acid.  However, under the conditions shown, the product retains a CO2Et group.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	5	Any Na atoms in the intermediate would be replaced by H upon aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	3	6	When a compound with two reactive functional groups undergoes a reaction, you need to think about an intramolecular reaction.
evalFeedback	3	7	An intramolecular C-C bond-forming reaction occurs under these conditions.  What nucleophilic C can combine with an electrophilic C to form a ring?
evalFeedback	3	8	Hemiacetals are not stable.  They collapse to carbonyl compounds by expelling a molecule of an alcohol.
evalFeedback	3	9	An acetal would not form under these conditions.
evalFeedback	3	10	A carboxylic acid is not formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	11	Ethers are formed from alkoxides and alkyl halides.  No alkyl halide is present in this reaction mixture.
evalFeedback	3	12	The product retains an ester; the acidic workup is not sufficiently strong to hydrolyze it.
evalFeedback	3	13	The only electrophile in the molecule is a carbonyl C.  In step 1, a nucleophilic C attacks this electrophile and expels EtO^-, leaving behind what functional group?
evalFeedback	3	14	All of the C-C bonds in the starting material remain unaltered in the product.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  In step 1, the #a-carbon is deprotonated.  In step 2, the PhSe group is attached to the #a-carbon.  In step 3, the PhSe group is oxidized, and it falls off, taking a H atom from the adjacent C with it and leaving behind an #a,#b-unsaturated carbonyl compound.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	4	4	A Li enolate is an intermediate, but no Li is present in the product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Br acts as a leaving group in C6H5SeBr.  No Br is present in the product.
evalFeedback	4	6	Although Se is incorporated into an intermediate, it is removed in the third step of the sequence.
evalFeedback	4	7	The Ph group remains attached to Se, which is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	8	LDA contains N, but its purpose in life is to deprotonate, so no N is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	9	The number of rings remains unchanged in this reaction.
evalFeedback	4	10	Count your carbons.  The number of C atoms remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	4	11	The methyl ester remains unchanged in this reaction.
evalFeedback	4	12	The number of O atoms does not change.  The H2O2 adds an O atom to the Se atom in an intermediate, but both the Se atom and the attached O are eliminated subsequently.
evalFeedback	4	13	This sequence of reactions results in an oxidation.  One way to oxidize an organic compound is to add a #pi bond (remove two H atoms).
evalFeedback	4	14	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in this sequence.
evalFeedback	4	15	Step 1 determines where the new #pi bond will go.  Which C atom is deprotonated in step 1?
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Step 1 deprotonates the #a-carbon.  Step 2 is an SN2 reaction to make a C-C bond.  Step 3 hydrolyzes the esters to acid and promotes decarboxylation to give a monoacid.
evalFeedback	5	2	This compound is obtained after step 2.  What will happen to it in step 3?
evalFeedback	5	3	The heat in step (3) will cause this intermediate to undergo a further reaction.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	6	Any Na atoms will be replaced with H in step 3.  There will be no Na atoms in the final product.
evalFeedback	5	7	Br is a leaving group.  There is no Br in the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	8	One of the CO2Et groups is lost, the other is converted into an acid, so the product should have only two O atoms.
evalFeedback	5	9	What happens to CO2Et groups in aqueous acid, as in step 3?
evalFeedback	5	10	Isobutyl bromide is (CH3)2CHCH2Br (four C atoms).
evalFeedback	5	11	Only one equivalent of base is used, so only one equivalent of i-BuBr is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	12	The product should have six contiguous C atoms--four from iBuBr and two from diethyl malonate.  One of the malonate C atoms is lost in decarboxylation.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Deprotonation of the #a-carbon of the ketone turns it into a nucleophile, and it attacks the carbonyl C of the carbonate, displacing EtO^-.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	4	Any Na atoms will be replaced by H in step 2.
evalFeedback	6	5	The acidic workup is not strong enough to hydrolyze any esters.
evalFeedback	6	6	The phenyl ring is not involved in the reaction.
evalFeedback	6	7	The enolate of the ketone is more nucleophilic at C than it is at O.
evalFeedback	6	8	Diethyl carbonate reacts under these conditions to give a product that is not a carbonate.
evalFeedback	6	9	Ethers do not form from ketones and carbonates.
evalFeedback	6	10	The ketone is retained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	11	In this reaction, a nucleophilic C attacks the carbonate's carbonyl C, expelling EtO^-.  What kind of functional group should be obtained?
evalFeedback	6	12	Which atom is deprotonated by the base?  To which atom does it make a bond?  Count your carbons carefully.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  The C atom between the two ketones is deprotonated, and the allyl group undergoes substitution there, displacing Br^-.
evalFeedback	7	2	That is a major by-product, and under some conditions it is the major product.  Under these conditions, though, C-alkylation predominates.
evalFeedback	7	3	The C atom of the allyl group that becomes attached to the ring C is the one that bore the Br atom in the starting material.
evalFeedback	7	5	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	7	6	The Na atom is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	7	7	Br is a leaving group. The product does not contain Br.
evalFeedback	7	8	All of the C-C and C-H bonds of allyl bromide are preserved unchanged in the product, as is the C=C #pi bond.
evalFeedback	7	9	Which C atom in the diketone is most likely to be deprotonated to make a nucleophile?  The other C atoms remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	7	10	Only one equivalent of each of the reagents is used, so dialkylation is unlikely to occur.  The number of C atoms in the product should equal the sum of the C atoms in the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	7	11	Enols rapidly tautomerize to the corresponding ketone.
evalFeedback	7	12	The product retains the functionality of the starting 1,3-diketone.
evalFeedback	7	13	NaOH is a base; its O atom is not incorporated into the product.  The number of O atoms in the two organic starting materials remains unchanged in the product.
evalFeedback	7	14	The formula of the product of this substitution reaction equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials, minus the elements of HBr.  (H is removed by the base, and Br is a leaving group.)
qStmt	8		Three distinct reactions take place in sequence in this process.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  A Michael reaction, and an aldol reaction, and an elimination of H2O provides the observed product.  The overall process is called the <i>Robinson annulation</i>.
evalFeedback	8	2	This compound is an intermediate, but it reacts further under the reaction conditions.  What can it do in the presence of base?
evalFeedback	8	3	Good!  A Michael reaction, and an aldol reaction, and an elimination of H2O provides the observed product.  The overall process is called the <i>Robinson annulation</i>.  Because of steric hindrance involved in the formation of a tetrasubstituted alkene, probably a different cyclohexenone would form.  Instead of the benzyl ketone of the Michael adduct acting as the nucleophile and the methyl ketone as the electrophile, have the methyl ketone act as the nucleophile and the benzyl ketone as the electrophile.
evalFeedback	8	4	This compound is an intermediate, but it reacts further under the reaction conditions.  What can it do in the presence of base?
evalFeedback	8	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	7	Any Na that might be present in the product would be replaced with H upon workup.
evalFeedback	8	8	Methyl vinyl ketone has two electrophilic sites.  Which one is the enolate of dibenzyl ketone most likely to attack?  (Hint: not the ketone.)
evalFeedback	8	9	Dibenzyl ketone is much more likely to be the nucleophile, and methyl vinyl ketone the electrophile.
evalFeedback	8	10	NaOH is a base.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.  The product should have no more O atoms than the two organic starting materials.
evalFeedback	8	11	The product retains one of the ketones of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	8	12	This reaction results in the formation of another ring.
evalFeedback	8	13	The formula of the product should equal the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials, minus the elements of H2O.
evalFeedback	8	14	The phenyl rings are unaffected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	8	15	The diphenyl ketone has a nucleophilic C (after deprotonation) adjacent to an electrophilic C.  The enone has a nucleophilic C (after deprotonation) separated from an electrophilic C by two more C atoms.  Connect the nucleophilic C atom in one starting material with the electrophilic C in the other, and vice versa.
evalFeedback	8	16	The product has a #pi bond between the C that formerly bore an O atom and the C atom that is now #a to the ketone.
qStmt	9		Pyrrolidine is a secondary amine in a five-membered ring, (CH2)4NH.
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  Step 1 forms an enamine, which converts the #a-carbon into a nucleophile.  Step 2 is an SN2 reaction to form a C-C bond.  Step 3 removes the amine and regenerates the ketone.
evalFeedback	9	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Believe it or not, there is no N in the product.  The pyrrolidine is only temporarily combined with the starting material; in step 3, it is removed to regenerate the original functional group.
evalFeedback	9	6	In step 3, the original functional group is regenerated.
evalFeedback	9	7	Assume only one equivalent of EtBr is added.  The number of C atoms in the product equals the sum of those in the ketone and EtBr.
evalFeedback	9	8	The formula of the product of this substitution reaction equals the sum of the formulas of the ketone and the bromide, minus the elements of HBr.
evalFeedback	9	9	Which C atom of the starting material is reactive towards electrophiles such as EtBr?
qStmt	10		Two distinct reactions occur sequentially in this process.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  An intramolecular aldol reaction is followed by elimination of H2O to give the product.
evalFeedback	10	2	This compound is an intermediate in the reaction sequence, but it undergoes another reaction.
evalFeedback	10	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	10	5	Aqueous workup will replace any Na atoms with H.
evalFeedback	10	6	The number of C atoms should not change.
evalFeedback	10	7	When a single substrate with two functional groups is treated with base, think about intramolecular reactions.
evalFeedback	10	8	NaOH is merely a base.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	9	Enols rapidly tautomerize to the corresponding carbonyl compounds.
evalFeedback	10	10	The enolate intermediate is more nucleophilic on C than it is on O.
evalFeedback	10	11	Seven-membered rings are rather slow to form. A ring of a different size is likely to form more quickly in this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	12	A nucleophilic C atom at one end of the molecule will react with an electrophilic C atom at the other.  Identify these atoms carefully.
evalFeedback	10	13	The product retains at least one ketone functional group.
evalFeedback	10	14	The formula of the product equals the formula of the starting material minus the elements of H2O.
evalFeedback	10	15	The product has a #pi bond between the C that formerly bore an O atom and the C atom that is now #a to the ketone.
evalFeedback	10	16	On which C atom should the ketone reside?
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  In the first step, the SOCl2 converts the acid into an acyl chloride.  In the second step, the acyl chloride reacts with Cl2 at the #a-carbon.  In the third step, the acyl chloride is hydrolyzed back to an acid, leaving the Cl atom on the #a-carbon.
evalFeedback	11	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	11	4	Although a short-lived intermediate in this reaction contains S, the final organic product does not contain any S.
evalFeedback	11	5	The number of C atoms remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	11	6	Look at the reagents.  What element should your product contain?
evalFeedback	11	7	Acyl chlorides are very reactive toward water, so an acyl chloride won't survive step 3.
evalFeedback	11	8	Step 1 converts the CO2H group to an acyl chloride (among other things), but step 2 converts the acyl chloride back to a carboxylic acid.
evalFeedback	11	9	Only one equivalent of Cl2 is used, and the #a-position is much less reactive after it has already been chlorinated once.
evalFeedback	11	10	Only one Cl atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	11	11	The product should not contain an alcohol.
evalFeedback	11	12	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.

header			<i>Hagemann's ester</i>, shown in the Figure, can be prepared by treating a 1:2 mixture of formaldehyde and ethyl acetoacetate first with base and then with acid and heat.  The first step is an aldol-like condensation, the second step is a Michael addition, the third step is an intramolecular aldol condensation, and the fourth step is a hydrolysis followed by a decarboxylation.

evalFeedback	2	8	The only change from starting materials to products is the formation of one new C-C and one new C-H bond, and the cleavage of a C-H bond and the C=C #pi bond.
qStmt	3		Draw the product of the third step.
evalFeedback	3	1	Excellent! The product from the second step undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to give a six-membered ring, and then elimination of H2O occurs to give the alkene.

evalFeedback	1	6	In the acetoacetic ester synthesis, the acetonyl (CH3-CO-CH2) part is derived from the acetoacetic ester.  The acetonyl group is represented in the 1H NMR by a singlet at ~2.1 ppm and a triplet  at ~2.4 ppm.

evalFeedback	2	9	The NMR spectrum shows no benzylic CH2 group in the product, so it is unlikely that such a group would be present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	2	10	Although the product contains an alkene, this functional group is not present in the starting materials.
evalFeedback	2	11	As the text problem states, both starting materials are carbonyl compounds.

evalFeedback	18	11	An atom does not normally use the electrons in a #sigma bond to H to make a new #sigma bond to another atom.
evalFeedback	18	12	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton by a four-centered transition state.  Better to protonate the O atom with the conjugate acid of the base that was used to initiate the reaction, and then use the resulting base to deprotonate the C atom.

evalFeedback	18	16	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.  The base deprotonates the C atom #a to the ketone, which then attacks the aldehyde C, forming the first C-C bond.  The alkoxide O atom is protonated by EtOH (produced in the first step), and EtO^- then deprotonates the #a-C atom again to give an enolate, which expels HO^- to give the product.

evalFeedback	19	4	No compound in this mechanism should have a total charge of &#177;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	19	5	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  You need to form a C-C bond.  One of the two C atoms in the starting material is already in a reactive form; the other is not.  Under these acidic conditions, what reactive form does the latter C atom assume before it makes a bond to the former C atom?
evalFeedback	19	7	Under these acidic conditions, no bases in this mechanism should have conjugate acids whose pKa >  10.
evalFeedback	19	8	Although you are correct that the C-O bond must break to form a carbocation, the particular carbocation that you have drawn does not form.  Instead, the compound isomerizes so that a carbocation much lower in energy (at the same position) can form.  Into what form can the compound isomerize prior to the C-O bond cleaving?
evalFeedback	19	9	Under these acidic conditions, by what mechanism would the elements of H2O be eliminated after the C-C bond forms?  What key intermediate would intervene?
evalFeedback	19	10	You should not draw a mechanistic step that involves an even number of electron pairs moving around in a circle.  If you are drawing a proton transfer step, use an exogenous H^+ to protonate one atom while you are deprotonting the other.
evalFeedback	19	11	An atom does not normally use the electrons in a #sigma bond to H to make a new #sigma bond to another atom.
evalFeedback	19	12	A C-O bond does not act as a nucleophile toward H^+.  The O atom should be protonated in a separate step before the C-O bond cleaves.
evalFeedback	19	13	Most chemists would protonate the aldehyde O atom <i>before</i> the C-C bond forms, not at the same time as the C-C bond forms.
evalFeedback	19	14	When converting a ketone to an enol, most chemists would protonate the O atom <i>before</i> deprotonating the #a-C atom, not do both at the same time.
evalFeedback	19	15	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.  You can accomplish the same purpose with fewer electron-flow arrows.
evalFeedback	19	16	Boxes connected by a double-headed reaction arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	19	17	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed reaction arrow.
evalFeedback	19	18	Good!  The ketone is converted into the enol (in two steps) before attacking the protonated aldehyde.  The product aldol enolizes again before losing H2O in a two-step, E1 elimination mechanism.

evalFeedback	23	9	Although it is tempting to go ahead and do the Dieckmann reaction to form the #b-keto ester immediately after you form the first C-C bond, this sequence is incorrect.  To form a nine-membered ring is unfavorable, and, if you form this ring first, it becomes very hard to form the remaining C-C bond.

evalFeedback	30	9	The bond between a leaving group and an sp2-hybridized C atom cannot ionize to leave behind a carbocation.  Better to add H2O across the #pi bond first; then you can break the desired C-O bond with impunity.

evalFeedback	36	11	After the rearrangement and loss of the diazo group to give the ketene, what bond needs to form?  Under these acidic conditions (HCl is produced in step 1), what must happen to the ketene first?
evalFeedback	36	12	It is poor practice to transfer a proton by a four-membered transition state.  Better to draw the proton transfer in two steps: first protonate the C atom, then deprotonate the O atom.  (The conditions are acidic because HCl was generated in step 1, so you want to deprotonate first.)  Or, have another molecule of benzyl alcohol simultaneously protonate the C with its alcohol H and deprotonate the O with its alcohol O.

evalFeedback	37	9	The EtO^- could in principle displace Br^- in an SN2 reaction, but the product does not contain a CH2-OEt bond, so why make this bond?  What other electrophile can EtO^- react with?

Topic: Carbonyl reactions at the &alpha;-carbon; Set: Multistep synthesis
qStmt	1		Draw the starting materials that are best used to make the compound shown by an alkylation reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  The bond between the #a- and #b-C atoms is disconnected, the #a-C gains an H atom, and the #b-C gains a leaving group.  Because the #b-C is secondary, one of the H atoms on the #a-C needs to be replaced with a CO2Et group.  In the forward direction, NaOEt will deprotonate the nucleophile, and the alkyl halide will be added.  Hydrolysis of the diester and decarboxylation will give the monoacid, which will be converted back to the ester with EtOH and acid.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw two starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw neutral starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	4	Which bond is disconnected when a carbonyl compound can be made by an alkylation reaction?  Don't disconnect any other bonds.
evalFeedback	1	5	An alcohol is not a good electrophile under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	1	6	The former #b-C must have a leaving group attached to it in the starting material.
evalFeedback	1	7	The leaving group should be attached to the former #b-carbon.  Nothing else in the electrophile should be changed.
evalFeedback	1	8	You have drawn ethyl acetate as your nucleophile.  The enolate of this simple carbonyl compound is considered both a good nucleophile and a good base.  Because the electrophile is secondary, cyclic, and homoallylic, E^2 elimination will predominate.  What can you do to the nucleophile to make it more prone to do substitution?
evalFeedback	1	9	You're on the right track, but not quite there.  The CO2H group is not the group you want to use to acidify the #a-carbon of the nucleophile, because when a base comes along, it will deprotonate the CO2H group, not the #a-carbon.  What related group should you use?
evalFeedback	1	10	You're right that a second carbonyl group needs to be added to the nucleophilic C to soften it up, but the carbonyl O should not be attached directly to the #a-carbon of the ester, because a directly attached =O does nothing to make the #a-carbon more acidic.
evalFeedback	1	11	You're right that a second carbonyl group needs to be added to the nucleophilic C to soften it up, but you have not chosen the appropriate kind of carbonyl group.  What carbonyl group in particular can be easily removed after the alkylation step is complete?
evalFeedback	1	12	A group needs to be added to the #a-carbon of the nucleophile to make the #a-carbon more acidic, but it needs to be removable later.  The group you have added doesn't satisfy both of those conditions.  What functional group, when attached to the #a-carbon, will make it more acidic and will be easily removable later?
qStmt	2		Draw the starting materials that are best used to make the compound shown by a Michael reaction.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  Calling the C atoms between the ketone and CN groups the #a-, #b-, and #gamma-C atoms, the bond between the #b- and #gamma-C atoms is disconnected, the #gamma-C gains an H atom, and a #pi bond is placed between the #a- and #b-C atoms.  For a Michael reaction, a fairly acidic nucleophile should be used, so one of the H atoms on the #gamma-C needs to be replaced with a CO2Et group.  Two different disconnections can be made: one where the #a-C is next to the ketone, and one where the #a-C is next to the CN group.
evalFeedback	2	2	Right!  Calling the C atoms between the ketone and CN groups the #a-, #b-, and #gamma-C atoms, the bond between the #b- and #gamma-C atoms is disconnected, the #gamma-C gains an H atom, and a #pi bond is placed between the #a- and #b-C atoms.  For a Michael reaction, a fairly acidic nucleophile should be used, so one of the H atoms on the #gamma-C needs to be replaced with a CO2Et group.  Two different disconnections can be made: one where the #a-C is next to the ketone, and one where the #a-C is next to the CN group.

evalFeedback	2	10	Butanenitrile, a simple nitrile, is not very acidic, and fairly acidic compounds are required for good yields in Michael reactions.  What can you do to it to make it more acidic?
evalFeedback	2	11	Calling the C atoms between the ketone and CN groups the #a-, #b-, and #gamma-C atoms, disconnect the bond between the #b- and #gamma-C atoms, and place a #pi bond between the #a- and #b-C atoms.
qStmt	3		Draw the starting materials that are best used to make the compound shown by an alkylation reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The bond between the #a- and #b-C atoms is disconnected, the #a-C gains an H atom, and the #b-C gains a leaving group.  One of the H atoms on the #a-C can be replaced with a CO2Et group, although it's not necessary.
evalFeedback	3	2	You should choose a disconnection that divides the compound into two pieces.  The disconnection you chose, while technically correct, makes the synthetic problem more difficult, not easier.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw two starting materials.

evalFeedback	3	7	The former #b-C must have a leaving group attached to it in the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	8	The leaving group should be attached to the former #b-carbon.  Nothing else in the electrophile should be changed.

qStmt	4		Draw the starting materials that are best used to make the compound shown.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  The bond between the #a-C and the #b-C that bears the OH group is disconnected, the #a-C gets an H atom, and the #b-C gets a #pi bond to the O atom to which it is attached.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw two starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw neutral starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	4	Although you are correct that you should disconnect the bond between the #a-C and the #b-C, there is a better such disconnection than the one you chose.  Which bond in a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound is best disconnected?
evalFeedback	4	5	Although you are correct that you should disconnect the bond between the alcohol C and an adjacent C, there is a better such disconnection than the one you chose.  Which bond in a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound is best disconnected?
evalFeedback	4	6	You have chosen a Friedel-Crafts disconnection, but there is a better answer.  Which bond in a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound is best disconnected?
evalFeedback	4	7	Which bond in a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound is best disconnected?  Don't disconnect any other bonds.
evalFeedback	4	8	All of the C-H bonds in the target are also present in the starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	9	When disconnecting the bond between the #a- and #b-C atoms in a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound, what functional group should the #b-C acquire in the starting material?
evalFeedback	4	10	When a #b-hydroxy carbonyl compound is disconnected, it is best not to add a CO2R group to the #a-C in the starting material, because the presence of this group will promote elimination of H2O from the target.
evalFeedback	4	11	The former #a-carbon gains an H atom in the starting material.  Nothing else should change.
qStmt	5		Draw the acyclic starting material that can be used most conveniently to make the following compound.

qStmt	6		Draw the starting materials that are best used to make the compound shown by a Michael reaction.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Calling the C atoms between the ketone and ester groups the #a-, #b-, and #gamma-C atoms, the bond between the #b- and #gamma-C atoms is disconnected, the #gamma-C gains an H atom, and a #pi bond is placed between the #a- and #b-C atoms.  For a Michael reaction, a fairly acidic nucleophile should be used, but the nucleophile here is already very acidic because it is a 1,3-diketone.

evalFeedback	8	2	In principle, it should be possible for you to combine a monosubstituted malonate anion with a 2&deg; alkyl halide, and you may get some of the desired product, but cyclopentyl halides are particularly prone to undergo elimination, and this nucleophile is particularly hindered, so you will get a lot of elimination.  What less hindered (and equally weakly basic) nucleophile can you use to form the desired C-C bond?  (Think about altering the sequence of bond-forming reactions.)

evalFeedback	8	6	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	8	7	Good!  The compound must be disconnected between the #a-carbon and both #b-carbons.  Because one of the #b-carbons is branched, and because after both disconnections the #a-carbon becomes a CH3 group, it is necessary to retrosynthetically add an additional CO2Et group to the #a-carbon.
qStmt	9		Prepare the target ketone from neutral, metal-free starting materials (except those chosen from the menu) containing no more than seven contiguous C atoms.  <P>If you want to deprotonate a compound <i>stoichiometrically</i>, choose the appropriate base as a  reaction condition, draw the compound's conjugate base in the next step along with the electrophile, and draw the product in the subsequent box.  <P>If you want to deprotonate a compound in an <i>unfavorable equilibrium</i>, then draw the compound and the electrophile in the same box, choose the appropriate base as a reaction condition, and draw the product in the subsequent box.

The ester can be disconnected at both #a-C&ndash;#b-C bonds to give benzyl bromide and ethyl acetate.  But ethyl acetate is not a good starting material to deprotonate; better to use diethyl malonate.
qStmt	10		Prepare the target compound from neutral, metal-free starting materials (other than those from the reaction conditions menu) containing up to four contiguous C atoms.  <P>If you want to deprotonate a compound <i>stoichiometrically</i>, choose the appropriate base as a reaction condition, draw the compound's conjugate base in the next step along with the electrophile, and draw the product in the subsequent box.  <P>If you want to deprotonate a compound in an <i>unfavorable equilibrium</i>, then draw the compound and the electrophile in the same box, choose the appropriate base as a reaction condition, and draw the product in the subsequent box.

evalFeedback	10	2	To make #b-keto esters, it is best to combine two esters (one the nucleophile, the other the electrophile) with an excess of a moderate base and heat.  The LDA method doesn't work very well in most cases.

evalFeedback	11	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	11	5	Good!  Disconnect the #a-#b C=C bond to give a simple ketone and an aldehyde.  Disconnect the ketone at the #a-#b C-C bond to give acetone and an alkyl halide.  But acetone is not a good substrate to use as a nucleophile; use ethyl acetoacetate instead.

Disconnect the 1,3-diketone at the C(1)-C(2) or C(2)-C(3) bond to give a keto diester.  This compound contains a 1,5-dcarbonyl, the retron for the Michael reaction.  You can start with CH3CH(CO2Et)2 and do a Michael reaction with CH2=CHC(=O)CH3, or you can start with EtO2CCH(CH3)C(=O)CH3 and do a Michael reaction with CH2=CHCO2Et.

Then disconnect the 1,3-diketone at the C(1)-C(2) or C(2)-C(3) bond to give a keto ester.  This compound contains a 1,5-dcarbonyl, the retron for the Michael reaction.  Disconnect at the #a-#b C-C bond of the 1,5-dicarbonyl and introduce a #b-#gamma double bond.

qStmt	2		The manager of an organic chemistry stockroom prepared an unknown for a "Ketones and Aldehydes" experiment by taking two drops of a liquid from a bottle marked "Heptaldehyde", placing it in a test tube, and stirring it for several days until it was needed. The unknown was misidentified by every student, however. The stockroom manager took an IR spectrum of the liquid in the "Heptaldehyde" bottle and found a sharp stretch around 1710 cm^^-1 and small, sharp peaks around 2710 and 2810 cm^^-1 .  By contrast, the students' spectra showed no peaks at 2710 or 2810 cm^^-1 , but a broad absorption centered over 3000 cm^^-1 and a peak around 1715 cm^^-1 . They also maintained that their samples were soluble in dilute aq. NaOH. Identify the compound in the students' test tubes.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! Contact with oxygen from the air oxidized the sensitive aldehyde group to the acid.
evalFeedback	2	2	The students' samples don't show the peaks at 2710 and 2810 cm^^-1 characteristic of an aldehyde. Instead, they see a broad absorption around 3000 cm^^-1 . What functional group is signified by this absorbance?

qStmt	3		The following NMR spectrum corresponds to a compound of formula C9H10O2. Propose a structure for it.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right! The ^1H singlet at 11.8 ppm indicates a COOH group. The five aromatic protons suggest that a Ph group is present. The upfield 3H doublet and the downfield ^1H quartet indicate a CHCH3 structure.

evalFeedback	4	1	Right! The ^1H singlet at 12 ppm indicates a COOH group. The two ^1H singlets at 6.2 and 5.7 ppm suggest a 1,1-disubstituted alkene. The 3H singlet at 1.9 ppm indicates an isolated CH3 group.

evalFeedback	4	7	Your structure does not match the indicated NMR spectra.
qStmt	5		The following 200 MHz NMR spectrum corresponds to a compound of formula C6H10O2. Propose a structure for it.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The broad ^1H singlet at 12 ppm indicates a COOH group. The two ^1H multiplets at 5.8 and 7.1 ppm indicate a 1,2-disubstituted alkene, and the downfield nature of the 7.1 ppm resonance suggests that it is conjugated to the CO2H group.  The last three peaks in the ratio of 2:2:3 indicate a CH2CH2CH3 group.  Finally, the large coupling constant of the alkene H atoms (ca. 0.1 ppm, 20 Hz) indicates that the alkene is trans.
evalFeedback	5	2	You're almost right! The doublet at 5.7 ppm has a large coupling constant (ca. 0.1 ppm x 200 MHz = ca. 20 Hz).  A cis alkene such as the one you drew would have a much smaller coupling constant of about 10 Hz.  What structure would have a much larger coupling constant?
evalFeedback	5	3	Your structure is correct, but is the compound the E or Z diastereomer?  The coupling constant between the alkenyl H atoms tells you the answer.
evalFeedback	5	4	Your structure does not have the indicated formula.

evalFeedback	5	6	What functional group is indicated by the ^1H resonances at 5.8 and 7.1 ppm?

evalFeedback	5	8	A 1,1-disubstituted alkene would have a very small coupling constant between the two alkenyl H atoms.  The compound in question has a very large coupling constant between them.
evalFeedback	5	9	The three upfield resonances &#8212; 2H quartet, 2H sextet, and 3H triplet &#8212; indicate what kind of alkyl group in your structure?

qStmt	6		A student has just added ammonia to hexanoic acid and has begun to heat the mixture when he is called away to the telephone.

Among the components he isolates are a liquid with molecular formula C6H11N whose IR spectrum shows a strong, sharp absorption at 2247 cm^^-1 . Determine the structure of this compound.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right! An amide can be formed when hexanoic acid is overheated with NH3, and the amide can lose H2O with further overheating to give the nitrile.
evalFeedback	6	2	Your structure does not have the molecular formula C6H11N.
evalFeedback	6	3	No C-C bonds are formed or broken when hexanoic acid reacts with ammonia and the reaction mixture is heated.
evalFeedback	6	4	What functional group is indicated by an IR absorbance around 2200 cm^^-1 ?
qStmt	7		A student has just added ammonia to hexanoic acid and has begun to heat the mixture when he is called away to the telephone. After a long telephone conversation, he returns to find that the mixture  has overheated and turned black. He distills the volatile components and recrystallizes the solid residue. Among the components he isolates are a solid with molecular formula C6H13NO whose IR spectrum shows absorptions at 3390, 3200, and 1665 cm^^-1 . Determine the structure of this compound.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right! An amide is formed in the reaction of hexanoic acid with NH3. (This reaction doesn't usually work very well, because the acid-base reaction between the two makes the components much less electrophilic and nucleophilic, respectively, but if they are heated enough, a reaction will eventually occur.)  The amide group shows in IR spectrum two spikes at 3390 and 3200 cm^^-1 (N-H bond) and a peak at 1665 cm^^-1 for the carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	7	2	Your structure does not have the molecular formula C6H13NO.
evalFeedback	7	3	No C-C bonds are formed or broken when hexanoic acid reacts with ammonia and the reaction mixture is heated.
evalFeedback	7	4	What functional group is indicated by an IR absorbance at 1665 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	7	5	The two sharp absorbances at 3390 and 3200 cm^^-1 indicate what functional group?  Be aware that a carbonyl is also present.
qStmt	8		A chemist was called to an abandoned aspirin factory to determine the contents of a badly corroded vat. Knowing that two salvage workers had become ill from breathing the fumes, she put on her breathing apparatus as soon as she noticed an overpowering odor like that of vinegar but much more pungent. She entered the building and took a sample of the contents of the vat. The mass spectrum showed a mass of 102 amu, and the NMR spectrum showed only a singlet at 2.15 ppm. The IR spectrum, which appears below, left no doubt about the identity of the compound.  Identify the compound.
evalFeedback	8	1	Very good! The singlet at 2.15 ppm suggests that a methyl group next to a carbonyl group is present. The IR spectrum shows no OH group present. The two carbonyl absorptions at high frequency are the characteristics of an anhydride. The molecular ion at 102 proves that the compound is acetic anhydride.
evalFeedback	8	2	The mass of the structure you have drawn is not 102 amu.
evalFeedback	8	3	What functionality shows a strong IR absorbance at around 1755 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	8	4	The singlet at 2.15 ppm in the H NMR spectrum indicates what substructure?

qStmt	9		An unknown compound gives a mass spectrum with a weak molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 113 and a prominent ion at <i>m/z</i> 68. Its NMR and IR spectra are shown below. Determine the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	9	1	Very good! The sharp IR absorbance at 2250 cm^^-1 indicates a CN group. The ester group is responsible for the IR absorbance at 1750 cm^^-1 . The 3H triplet at 1.3 ppm and the ^2H quartet at 4.3 ppm indicate an ethyl group attached to an O atom. The ^2H singlet at 3.5 ppm shows an isolated CH2 group.
evalFeedback	9	2	What does the molecular ion at <i>m/z</i> 113 tell you about the number of N atoms present in the molecule?
evalFeedback	9	3	The structure you have drawn does not weigh 113 amu.
evalFeedback	9	4	What functional group is indicated by the IR absorbance at 2250 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	9	5	If this compound were an aldehyde, it would have an absorbance around 2700 cm^^-1 , and its NMR spectrum would have a resonance far downfield.
evalFeedback	9	6	If this compound were a ketone, it would show a C NMR resonance around 200 ppm.  What other carbonyl functionality would have a C NMR resonance at 164 ppm?
evalFeedback	9	7	What functional group is indicated by the IR absorbance at 1750 cm^^-1 and the C NMR resonance at 164 ppm?
evalFeedback	9	8	What substructure is indicated by a ^2H quartet downfield of 4.0 ppm and an upfield 3H triplet in the H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	9	9	Your structure does not match the indicated spectra.
qStmt	10		An unknown of molecular formula C5H9NO gives the IR and NMR spectra shown below. The broad NMR peak at 7.55 ppm disappears when the sample is shaken with D2O. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	10	1	Very good! The formula C5H9NO has two degrees of unsaturation. There are no alkenyl H atoms, so no double bond present.  One carbonyl is present (1670 cm^^-1 ); this peak comes low in the carbonyl region, meaning that an amide is likely, a conclusion confirmed by the C NMR resonance at 174 ppm. One broad peak in the NH region hints that a secondary amide is present.  With no other signs of unsaturation, the compound probably has a ring.  The lack of any 3H resonances in the NMR spectrum suggests that all C atoms are contained in the ring.
evalFeedback	10	2	Your structure does not have the molecular formula C5H9NO.
evalFeedback	10	3	What functional group is indicated by the IR absorbance at 1670 cm^^-1 and the C  NMR resonance at 174 ppm?
evalFeedback	10	4	What kind of carbonyl functional group is indicated by the IR absorbance at 1670 cm^^-1 , the single, broad IR absorbance at 3300 cm^^-1 , the C NMR resonance at 174 ppm, and the H NMR resonance at 7.55 ppm that disappears upon shaking with D2O?
evalFeedback	10	5	There are no alkenyl H atoms in the NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	10	6	No 3H resonance is observed in the H NMR spectrum, so it is unlikely that the compound contains a CH3 group.
evalFeedback	10	7	Your structure does not match the indicated spectra.
qStmt	11		An unknown compound gives the NMR, IR, and the mass spectra shown. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	11	1	Correct! The peaks at 1720 and 1200 cm^^-1 indicate an ester; the one at 1660 cm^^-1 indicates a C=C bond. The NMR spectrum shows a triplet (3H, 1.3 ppm) and a quartet (2H, 4.2 ppm) indicating an ethyl group attached to an O atom. The 3H doublet at 1.8 ppm is likely to be a CH3 group next to one H. The large coupling constant in the doublet at 5.8 ppm shows that it must be a trans double bond present.
evalFeedback	11	2	The overall structure is right, but if this were the compound, the coupling constant between the H NMR resonances at 5.8 and 7.0 ppm would be around 10 Hz, not about 14 Hz.
evalFeedback	11	3	Please indicate the configuration of the double bond.
evalFeedback	11	4	What is the mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	11	5	What functional group does the IR absorbance at 1710 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	11	6	If this carbonyl compound were a ketone, it would have a C NMR resonance around 200 ppm.  What other carbonyl functionality is consistent with the spectra?
evalFeedback	11	7	What functional group do the IR absorbance at 1710 cm^^-1 and the C NMR resonance at 167 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	11	8	What kind of ester do the ^2H quartet at 4.2 ppm and the 3H triplet at 1.3 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	11	9	What functional group do the H NMR resonances at 5.8 and 7.0 ppm, the C NMR resonances at 123 and 144 ppm, and the IR absorbance at 1660 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	11	10	What do the integrations of the H NMR resonances at 5.8 and 7.0 ppm tell you about the substitution level of the alkene?
evalFeedback	11	11	If this compound were a 1,1-disubstituted alkene, the coupling constant between the two alkenyl H atoms would be very small (ca. 2 Hz), and it is not.
evalFeedback	11	12	Your structure does not match the indicated spectra.
qStmt	12		The H NMR, C NMR, and IR spectra of an unknown compound (C6H8O3) appear below. Determine the structure of this compound.
evalFeedback	12	1	Very good! The formula C6H8O3 indicates three elements of unsaturation. The IR absorbances at 1710 and 1760 cm^^-1 indicate a ketone and a 5-membered lactone (cyclic ester).  In the H NMR spectrum, the 3H singlet at 2.4 ppm indicates a methyl ketone, leaving the remaining C atoms for the lactone ring.  The ^2H multiplet at 4.3-4.4 ppm is due to the CH2 group adjacent to the lactone O, and the downfield location and multiplicity of the ^1H dd at 3.7 ppm suggests that the acetyl group must be attached to the #a-carbon of the ester.
evalFeedback	12	2	If this were the structure, the ^1H resonance at 3.7 ppm would be further upfield and would be a dddd, not a dd.  Where else can the acetyl group be placed on the ring?
evalFeedback	12	3	Your structure doesn't have the molecular formula C6H8O3.
evalFeedback	12	4	Very clever! Indeed an anhydride would show two peaks in the carbonyl region, but they would be at a higher frequency. Consequently, the two peaks at 1770 and 1710 cm^^-1 are probably from two different carbonyl groups.
evalFeedback	12	5	What functional group do an IR absorbance at 1710 cm^^-1 and a C NMR resonance at 200 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	12	6	What functional group do an IR absorbance at 1760 cm^^-1 and a C NMR resonance at 172 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	12	7	The NMR and IR spectra show no sign of an alkene.
evalFeedback	12	8	Esters normally absorb at about 1735 cm^^-1 .  What does the higher-energy absorbance of this ester tell you about the nature of the substructure in which the ester carbonyl C is found?
evalFeedback	12	9	If a CH3 group with one or more H atoms on the adjacent C atom were present, a 3H multiplet would be seen, but the only 3H resonance is a singlet.
evalFeedback	12	10	What substructure is responsible for the sharp 3H singlet at 2.4 ppm in the H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	12	11	The ^2H multiplet at 4.3-4.4 ppm must be due to a CH2 group attached to the ester O.
evalFeedback	12	12	The structure you just drew doesn't match the indicated spectra.

evalFeedback	28	11	You have drawn an E2 mechanism for elimination.  What is the normal mechanism of elimination under acidic conditions such as these?

evalFeedback	29	12	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	29	13	It is considered bad practice to transfer a proton via a four-membered transition state. Better to protonate the basic atom with a H^+ different from the one obtained by deprotonation of the acidic atom.

qStmt	16		Design a synthesis of the following compound from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.
evalFeedback	16	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	16	2	When making an ester from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, if the alcohol is larger than MeOH or EtOH, it is better to make the acyl chloride first and then simply mix it with the alcohol.

evalFeedback	16	5	Good! The most efficient route is to convert the carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride, then to mix it with the alcohol. Another possibility is to use an SN2 substitution of the carboxylate reacting with the appropriate tosylate. (If you didn't come up with the second route, see if you can recreate it now in practice mode.)

evalFeedback	18	4	The highlighted stage contains a compound that you have gone to the trouble of making, but is a permissible starting material.
evalFeedback	18	5	Acyl chlorides tend to undergo racemization (loss of configurational purity) at the #a-stereocenter. Better to use a method that avoids going through the acyl chloride.

evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	6	Although aldolase will cleave the central C-C bond in fructose 1,6-diphosphate, the NaBH4 reaction will occur before the C-C cleavage occurs, so the product retains the six-carbon unit in fructose.
evalFeedback	1	7	The C network of the fructose remains intact, and the C-O bonds in the starting material (except the C=O bond) remain intact.

evalFeedback	2	2	Surprise!  This compound is not obtained.  What else could happen to the starting material under these basic conditions?  Think about neighboring-group participation.
evalFeedback	2	3	This compound is an intermediate, but it reacts further with ^-CN.

evalFeedback	5	6	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	8	8	Lysozyme is an acid catalyst.  Which bond is most likely to cleave under acidic catalysis?
evalFeedback	8	9	The NHAc group remains intact.
evalFeedback	8	10	This reaction requires the addition of H2O, so the product should have six O atoms.
qStmt	9		Lactase catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose (Figure) by exactly the same mechanism by which lysozyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls. Design a stable transition-state analog for the hydrolysis of lactose. (Hint: What is the key unstable intermediate in lactose hydrolysis? What atom could be substituted with another one to make a much more stable intermediate that would still bind tightly to the enzyme?)
evalFeedback	9	1	Excellent!  The key intermediate in the hydrolysis has a #pi bond between the ring O and C^1, and the analog replaces the ring O with N to give a stable compound.
evalFeedback	9	2	This compound is the key unstable intermediate in lactose hydrolysis, but it is not stable.  What neutral atom could be substituted for O^+ to make a stable, isolable analog?  (How many bonds does the O^+ make?  What atom "normally" makes that number of bonds?)

evalFeedback	10	1	Right! In one product, double inversion has occurred.  In the other, the N and S have switched places.
evalFeedback	10	2	One of the products you drew (the one with the Me group in a five-membered ring) is correct.  The other one has the correct skeleton but the wrong stereochemistry.  You drew the simple inversion product, normally a good guess under basic conditions, but in this case, the N atom participates and alters the stereochemical course of the reaction.
evalFeedback	10	3	One of the products you drew (the one with the Me group in a five-membered ring) is correct.  The other one has the correct skeleton but the wrong stereochemistry.  Draw the key intermediate and think about what other product could be obtained.
evalFeedback	10	4	One of the products you drew (the one with the Me group on the C adjacent to the PhS group) is correct.  The other one has the correct skeleton but the wrong stereochemistry.  Hint: If stereochemical retention is occurring, how many SN2 substitutions are occurring?  Draw the key intermediate and think about what other product could be obtained.
evalFeedback	10	5	One of the products you drew (the one with the Me group on the C adjacent to the PhS group) is correct.  The other one has the wrong skeleton.  Hint: If stereochemical retention is occurring, how many SN2 substitutions are occurring?  Draw the key intermediate and think about what other product could be obtained.

evalFeedback	10	8	That's one of the products, the product of N migration.  Please draw the other one, too, in which the N atom hasn't migrated.
evalFeedback	10	9	Surprise!  You have the skeleton right, but a different stereoisomer is obtained.  What does that suggest about the mechanism for PhS^- substitution in compound C?  Hint: The N atom is involved.
evalFeedback	10	10	Both compounds have the correct skeletons, but either you have not specified the configurations of all stereocenters, or some are specified incorrectly.
evalFeedback	10	11	None of the products you drew is correct.  Draw just one molecule and maybe we can work our way to at least one right answer.
evalFeedback	10	12	The skeleton is correct, but either you have not specified the stereochemistry properly, or you have omitted the stereochemistry at some stereocenters.
evalFeedback	10	13	The compound you drew is an intermediate, but it is opened by PhS^- .
evalFeedback	10	14	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	15	Neither product contains the TsO^- group.

evalFeedback	1	4	The aldehyde group remains unchanged in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	5	A Diels-Alder reaction always produces one new ring.
evalFeedback	1	6	The product of the Diels-Alder reaction is a cyclohexene (has one #pi bond in the new ring).
evalFeedback	1	7	The formula of the product is the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	8	The Diels-Alder reaction creates a new all-carbon six-membered ring.
evalFeedback	1	9	Make two new #sigma bonds between the termini of the diene and the two C atoms of the dienophile, remove one #pi bond from the dienophile and two from the diene, and add one #pi bond between the middle two C atoms of what used to be the diene.  Nothing else changes.

evalFeedback	2	6	A Diels-Alder reaction always gives a six-membered ring with a #pi bond.
evalFeedback	2	7	The formula of the product is the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	2	8	The new #pi bond in the product should be between the middle two C atoms of the diene component.
evalFeedback	2	9	In a Diels-Alder reaction, the substituents on each component should end up in either a 1,2- or 1,4-relationship (whichever is possible).
evalFeedback	2	10	The methyl group cannot end up on the C adjacent to the CN group.  If you carve the atoms of the dienophile out of your product, you will see that the skeleton of the diene does not match the starting material.

evalFeedback	3	2	Almost perfect!  A new cyclohexene ring is formed, the MeO group ends up in a 1,2-relationship with the C=O group, and the two H atoms at the ring fusion retain their cis orientation.

evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  A bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene is formed, and the triple bond becomes a double bond. The two bridgehead H atoms are cis.
evalFeedback	5	2	The structure is correct, but you need to show properly the stereochemistry about the new double bond derived from the triple bond.
evalFeedback	5	3	Please indicate the relative configurations of the two bridgehead C atoms.
evalFeedback	5	4	In the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile (in this case an alkyne) loses one #pi bond in the product.

evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  A cyclohexene ring is formed, and the MeO group ends up in a cis 1,2-relationship with the C=O group.
evalFeedback	7	2	You're almost right! But pay attention to the stereochemistry of the substituents. Diels-Alder reactions usually give the more sterically congested diastereomer of the product (the endo rule).
evalFeedback	7	3	Almost perfect!  A cyclohexene ring is formed, and the MeO group ends up in a 1,2-relationship with the CHO group.  The only thing missing is the relative configuration of the MeO and CHO groups.

Nothing else changes.
qStmt	9		(The Diels-Alder reaction of anthracene with maleic anhydride is a common organic lab experiment.)
evalFeedback	9	1	Very good! The middle ring from anthracene will react as a diene so that two new benzene rings are formed, as opposed to a naphthalene ring that would be formed if a side benzene ring reacts.  The H atoms of the maleic anhydride ring retain their cis stereochemistry in the product.

evalFeedback	2	10	The two atoms of HCl attach to C(sp2) atoms, and a #pi bond is consumed.
qStmt	3		Give the major thermodynamic product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  C^1 is protonated to give an allylic, doubly tertiary carbocation, and Cl^- adds to the cation to give the product.
evalFeedback	3	2	H^+ can add to the diene to give one of two allylic carbocations. Which one is lower in energy?  (Hint: It's the one in which both resonance structures have more substituted carbocations.)  The product should be derived from this one.
evalFeedback	3	3	Initially H^+ adds to the diene to give the lowest energy carbocation possible.  This carbocation should be stabilized by resonance (an allylic carbocation), and the product should be derived from this carbocation.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	Only one equivalent of HCl is used.
evalFeedback	3	7	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	3	8	No rearrangements or change in the number of C atoms occurs in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	9	HCl adds across a #pi bond, and the product has one fewer #pi bond.
qStmt	4		Predict the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  C^1 is protonated to give an allylic, doubly tertiary carbocation, and Cl^- adds to the cation to give the product.
evalFeedback	4	2	Initially H^+ adds to the diene to give the lowest energy carbocation possible. This carbocation should be stabilized by resonance (an allylic carbocation), and the product should be derived from this carbocation.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	4	5	One equivalent of HCl reacts with the diene.
evalFeedback	4	6	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	7	No rearrangements occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	4	8	HCl adds across a #pi bond, and the C(sp2) atoms become C(sp3), so Cl cannot be attached to C(sp2) in the product.
qStmt	5		Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  After the bromonium ion is formed, the OH can attack any of three electrophilic C atoms.  It attacks the one that is least hindered and gives the most substituted alkene in its least sterically hindered diastereomeric form.
evalFeedback	5	2	Your answer is a good one.  Markovnikov addition of Br (electrophile) and OH (nucleophile) across a #pi bond gives this product.  However, another product predominates.  After the bromonium ion forms between C1 and C2, which C atoms other than C2 are electrophilic?
evalFeedback	5	3	You have drawn an anti-Markovnikov product, in which the nucleophile attacked the less substituted C atom.
evalFeedback	5	4	Why would the compound give a cis alkene when it could give a lower-energy diastereomer?
evalFeedback	5	5	Please indicate the double-bond stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	5	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	7	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	5	8	The product should contain only the elements that are present in the starting materials.
evalFeedback	5	9	Assume only one equivalent of Br2 is added.
evalFeedback	5	10	The concentration of H2O (a nucleophilic solvent) is greater than the concentration of Br^- generated by the addition of Br2 to the diene, so how many Br atoms should your compound have?
evalFeedback	5	11	Br2 is the electrophile in this reaction, so the product should contain Br.
evalFeedback	5	12	The starting material has two #pi bonds. Only one equivalent of Br2 electrophile is added. One #pi bond will be consumed in the addition reaction. The other is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	5	13	H2O is in great concentration (solvent). What functional group do you have after addition of H2O to a double bond?
evalFeedback	5	14	Only one equivalent of H2O reacts with the electrophilic intermediate.
evalFeedback	5	15	No C-C or C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
qStmt	6		Predict the major products of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	6	1	Correct! One equivalent of Br2 is added to a terminal #pi bond to preserve diene conjugation in the bromonium ion, and the two major products also preserve diene conjugation.

evalFeedback	6	8	At least one of the compounds you drew is only a minor product.  The lowest-energy products have conjugated double bonds.
evalFeedback	6	9	You're missing at least one product.  It contains a conjugated diene.
qStmt	7		Give the products that are most likely to be obtained from the following reaction.
evalFeedback	7	1	Correct! One equivalent of HBr is added to a terminal #pi bond. The carbocation intermediate has two more resonance forms so the result will be three brominated hexadienes.
evalFeedback	7	2	You've drawn too many products.  Only the products that contain two double bonds are obtained in significant quantities.
evalFeedback	7	3	You've drawn two of the products correctly, but at least one more product is likely to be obtained.
evalFeedback	7	4	You've drawn two of the products correctly, but the remaining products are not correct.  Which C atom is preferentially protonated in step 1 of the mechanism?  Then which C atoms can combine with Br^- in step 2 of the mechanism to give the products?
evalFeedback	7	5	You've drawn one of the major products correctly, but there are more.
evalFeedback	7	6	The lowest energy products would have what double-bond configurations?
evalFeedback	7	7	Please specify the configuration at every double bond.
evalFeedback	7	8	You've drawn one of the major products correctly, but your other responses are incorrect in some way.  Which C atom is preferentially protonated in step 1 of the mechanism?  Then which C atoms can combine with Br^- in step 2 of the mechanism to give the products?
evalFeedback	7	9	Please draw neutral products.
evalFeedback	7	10	Exactly one equivalent of Br is added, so each product should contain a single Br atom.
evalFeedback	7	11	Each product's formula should equal the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	7	12	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.

qStmt	8		Give all of the possible products of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!
evalFeedback	8	2	Draw just one of the enantiomers (either one) of a racemic product, please.
evalFeedback	8	3	You've drawn too many products.  Only the products that contain two double bonds are obtained in significant quantities.
evalFeedback	8	4	You've drawn one product correctly, but you're missing some of the other possible products.
evalFeedback	8	5	What is the stereochemistry of Br2 addition across a #pi bond?  Look at the product in which both Br atoms are on the ring.
evalFeedback	8	6	In the product with two Br atoms on the ring, please indicate the relative stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	8	7	Please draw neutral products.
evalFeedback	8	8	Only one equivalent of Br2 is added, so only one #pi bond will react.
evalFeedback	8	9	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	10	Each product's formula should equal the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	8	11	You're missing at least one product.
qStmt	9		Many credit-card slips do not have carbon paper. Nevertheless, when you sign the slip, an imprint of your signature is made on the bottom copy. The carbonless paper contains tiny capsules that are filled with the colorless compound whose structure is shown below. When you press on the paper, the capsules burst and the colorless compound comes into contact with the acid-treated paper, forming a highly colored compound. 
What is the structure of the colored compound?
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  Before the addition of H^+, the compound is colorless, because the benzene rings are not conjugated with each other. In the presence of acid, an O atom is protonated, the ester C-O bond cleaves to give a carboxylic acid, and a carbocation is formed in which the three benzene rings are conjugated with each other. The conjugated carbocation is highly colored.
evalFeedback	9	2	When a molecule is protonated, what charge will that molecule have?
evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a single organic compound.
evalFeedback	9	4	No C-C bonds are broken or formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	5	The formula of the product equals the formula of the starting material plus H.  In other words, the change in going to the colored compound is quite minimal.
evalFeedback	9	6	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	7	The benzene rings are not protonated under these conditions.
evalFeedback	9	8	The lone pairs of the N atoms are conjugated to the aromatic rings, so they are not very basic.
evalFeedback	9	9	One of the O atoms indeed picks up a proton.  It then undergoes a reaction to become a neutral O.
evalFeedback	9	10	The colored compound does not retain the ester group.
evalFeedback	9	11	The colored compound retains a carbonyl group.
evalFeedback	9	12	What bond can break to give a highly resonance-stabilized carbocation?

evalFeedback	6	13	The Br atom should end up attached to a C that was part of a #pi bond in the starting material, but is not in the product.
evalFeedback	7	1	That's right!  Anti-Markovnikov and syn addition of H2O across both double bonds occurs.  The ring CH3 and the ring OH are trans in the product, but the other two stereocenters are indeterminate.
evalFeedback	7	2	Hydroboration does not proceed with anti addition of H and OH across the #pi bond.
evalFeedback	7	3	Hydroboration-oxidation is stereospecific.  Is it syn or anti?
evalFeedback	7	4	The regiochemistry is right, but this compound has three new stereocenters.  Please indicate their relative configuration.
evalFeedback	7	5	Yes, the product is a diol, but not this one.  Does hydroboration-oxidation proceed with Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity?
evalFeedback	7	6	Yes, the product is a diol, but not this one.  Both hydroboration-oxidations should proceed with which regioselectivity, Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov?

evalFeedback	7	8	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	9	Both alkene groups are consumed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	10	The product is not an ether.  THF is simply a solvent in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	11	You have drawn a hydroperoxide (has an OOH group). This reaction does not produce hydroperoxides. What functional group looks like a hydroperoxide but is much more common?
evalFeedback	7	12	Look at the second set of conditions.  What functional group is likely to be present in the product?
evalFeedback	7	13	These conditions do not result in the formation of 1,2-diols.

evalFeedback	7	15	Which C atoms of the starting material are most reactive? The OH should be attached to one of them.
evalFeedback	8	1	That's right!  Addition of H-H across the C=C bond is catalyzed by Pt.
evalFeedback	8	2	The Pt is used as a catalyst, so it isn't incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	8	3	The product of this reaction would not contain a C=C #pi bond.
evalFeedback	8	4	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  Markovnikov addition across both C=C #pi bonds occurs.
evalFeedback	9	2	Well, under certain conditions this could be the major product, but assume that air is excluded from the flask and that the solvent is free of peroxides, and remember Markovnikov's Rule.
evalFeedback	9	3	HBr will add across both alkenes with the same regioselectivity, Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov?
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	6	Both alkenes react with HBr to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	9	7	The reagent is HBr, so Br is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	8	Both double bonds react with HBr.
evalFeedback	9	9	A 1,2-dibromide is produced when Br2 adds across a C=C #pi bond, not when HBr adds.
evalFeedback	9	10	Two Br atoms are added when an alkene reacts with Br2, but the reagent here is HBr. A total of two bromine atoms are added, one for each double bond.
evalFeedback	9	11	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	9	12	The Br atoms in the product should be attached to the former alkene C atoms.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  Under free-radical conditions, anti-Markovnikov addition across the #pi bond occurs.

evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	10	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	6	The peroxide is merely a catalyst of this reaction, so O is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	7	Alkenes react with HBr to give a product that is not an alkene. Both double bonds  will react in this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	8	The reagent is HBr, so the product should incorporate at least one Br atom.
evalFeedback	10	9	Both double bonds will react under these conditions.
evalFeedback	10	10	A 1,2-dibromide is obtained when Br2 adds across an alkene, not when HBr does.
evalFeedback	10	11	More than one Br atom is incorporated into the product when alkenes react with Br2, but not with HBr.
evalFeedback	10	12	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	10	13	The Br atoms in the product should be attached to C atoms of the alkenes in the starting material.
evalFeedback	11	1	That's right!  Markovnikov addition takes place to put the OH group on the more substituted C atom and the Br atom on the less substituted one.  The HO and Br groups on the ring are trans to one another, but the configuration of the remaining stereocenters is indeterminate.
evalFeedback	11	2	Cohalogenation does not proceed with syn stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	11	3	Cohalogenation is stereospecific, and the HO and Br groups on the ring will have a specific relative configuration.  Would they add syn or anti?
evalFeedback	11	4	The product has two stereocenters on the cyclohexane ring.  Does the addition of HO and Br across the ring #pi bond proceed with syn, anti, or no stereospecificity?
evalFeedback	11	5	Yes, this reaction results in addition of Br and HO across the double bond, but with Markovnikov regiochemistry (the nucleophile adds to the C better able to bear a positive charge).
evalFeedback	11	6	The cohalogenation of both alkenes proceeds with the same regioselectivity, Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov?
evalFeedback	11	7	In a different solvent this answer would be correct, but H2O is a nucleophile that participates in the reaction.
evalFeedback	11	8	The final product is neutral.
evalFeedback	11	9	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	11	10	Both alkenes react with the reagents to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	11	11	What is the role of the Br2 in this reaction?
evalFeedback	11	12	Only one of the Br atoms of Br2 is incorporated into each double bond, acting as an electrophile.  The other Br atom does not act as a nucleophile, because an excess of another nucleophile is present.
evalFeedback	11	13	H2O, a nucleophilic solvent, participates in this reaction.
evalFeedback	11	14	Only one equivalent of H2O for each double bond participates in the reaction.
evalFeedback	11	15	When H2O participates in this reaction, it replaces one of its O-H bonds with an O-C bond, but the other O-H bond remains.
evalFeedback	11	16	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	11	17	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	1	That's right!  Cl2 adds across a C=C #pi bond with anti stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	12	2	Halogenation of an alkene does not proceed with syn stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	12	3	Halogenation of an alkene is stereospecific.  Is it syn or anti?
evalFeedback	12	4	Does addition of Cl2 proceed with syn, anti, or no stereospecificity?
evalFeedback	12	5	Please draw a single molecule as your response.
evalFeedback	12	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	12	7	Both alkenes react with Cl2 to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	12	8	One Cl atom in Cl2 acts as an electrophile; the other acts as a nucleophile. Both double bonds will react with Cl2.
evalFeedback	12	9	A skeletal rearrangement is unlikely to occur.
evalFeedback	12	10	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	13	1	Right!  The reaction sequence results in Markovnikov addition of H-OMe across both C=C bonds.
evalFeedback	13	2	Remember Markovnikov's rule.  MeOH is the nucleophile in this reaction; to which C does the OMe attach?
evalFeedback	13	3	Both alkenes react with the same regiochemistry, Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov?
evalFeedback	13	4	The final product is neutral.
evalFeedback	13	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	13	6	Na is merely a counterion.  It is not present in the organic product.
evalFeedback	13	7	The intermediate in this reaction contains Hg, but the purpose of the NaBH4 is to replace the Hg atom with another atom.
evalFeedback	13	8	The NaBH4 is a reducing agent, delivering H to the intermediate in this reaction. B is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	9	Both alkenes react with the reagents to give a product that is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	13	10	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	13	11	What is the nucleophile in step 1?  Its elements are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	13	12	The AcO group from the Hg(OAc)2 is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	13	Each alkene combines with only one MeO group.
evalFeedback	13	14	Both double bonds react under these conditions. How many O atoms are incorporated into the product for each alkene?
evalFeedback	13	15	Which atom of MeOH acts as the nucleophile?  Should an alcohol be present in the product?
evalFeedback	13	16	The OMe groups in the product should be attached to C atoms derived from the alkene in the starting material.

qStmt	3		<p>The stereochemistry of the product is indicated to help you identify the mechanism, but you do not need to indicate tetrahedral stereochemistry (bold and hashed bonds) in your mechanism. However, DO be careful not to alter the cis-trans stereochemistry of the starting alkene(s) in any of your intermediates. Also, when you draw electron-flow arrows to make new #sigma bonds, be careful that the incipient #sigma bond (indicated by a dashed, faint blue line) is indeed connecting the atoms that you intend it to connect. <p>You may find it easier to solve this problem by working backwards one step from the product. What reaction could lead to the given product? What compound would undergo that reaction to give the product? Then work forwards from the starting material to that compound. Don't forget to pay attention to the H atoms on and near the reactive atoms.

evalFeedback	1	1	The target compound of your synthesis does not match the requested target compound.
evalFeedback	1	2	You should use an #a,#b-unsaturated ethyl ester as one of your synthetic starting materials. The CO2Et group should be on the dienophile, because you want to use an electron-poor dienophile and an electron-rich diene.

evalFeedback	1	5	Think about double bond stereochemistry.

header			Draw the organic product or products of the following reaction.  If no reaction occurs, draw the starting material.  
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  The H^+ turns the O into a better leaving group, and Br^- acts as a nucleophile. The alcohol formed as an intermediate will convert further to another bromide.
evalFeedback	1	2	You're almost right. Also draw the product derived from the other part of the ether.
evalFeedback	1	3	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	1	4	An alcohol is formed as intermediate. Under the reaction conditions, the alcohol will be converted further to another product.
evalFeedback	1	5	Under strongly acidic conditions and in the presence of a good nucleophile such as Br^-, ethers undergo substitution reactions.
evalFeedback	1	6	It is unlikely that C-C or C-H bonds would be made or cleaved in this reaction.

evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  The H^+ turns the O into a better leaving group, and Br^- acts as a nucleophile. The intermediate alcohol will be converted further to another bromide under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	2	2	You're almost right. Also draw the organic product derived from the other part of the starting material.
evalFeedback	2	3	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	2	4	Under strongly acidic conditions and in the presence of a good nucleophile such as Br^-, ethers undergo substitution reactions.

evalFeedback	2	8	Both C-O bonds are broken in favor of what kind of bonds?
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Ethers are unreactive under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	3	2	A neutral compound is expected.
evalFeedback	3	3	Ethers are not electrophilic under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	4	1	You're right! Na is an electron donor. Ethers are not good electron acceptors, so there is no reaction.
evalFeedback	4	2	A neutral compound is expected.
evalFeedback	4	3	Na is an electron donor.  An ether is not an electron acceptor.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  Under these strongly acidic conditions and in the presence of the excellent nucleophile I^-, an ether can act as an electrophile in an SN2 reaction.  Only the C(sp3) attached to O will act as an electrophile; C(sp2) cannot be an electrophile in an SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	5	2	You're close. What happens with the other part of the ether?
evalFeedback	5	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	5	4	Under strongly acidic conditions and in the presence of a good nucleophile such as I^-, ethers undergo substitution reactions.
evalFeedback	5	5	C(sp2) can't act as an electrophile in SN1 or SN2 reactions, so will a new I-Ph bond form?
evalFeedback	5	6	The C(sp3) attached to O will act as an electrophile in an SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	5	7	No C-C or C-H bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	8	What reaction does an ether undergo when treated with HI?
evalFeedback	5	9	When ethers react with strong acids and excellent nucleophiles, they undergo a cleavage reaction.
evalFeedback	5	10	Only one of the C-O bonds breaks in this reaction.  The other C-O bond is inert to nucleophilic substitution.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles, one of the C-O bonds of the epoxide cleaves, and that C makes a new bond to the nucleophile.  Under acidic conditions, the more substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide ring forms the bond with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	6	2	Under acidic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at the C best able to bear a positive charge.
evalFeedback	6	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	6	4	The ring in the starting material is very strained.  It pops open upon reaction with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	6	5	No C-C or C-H bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	6	The nucleophile will be incorporated into the product, and the leaving group will remain in the product, too, because it is attached to the substrate through <i>two</i> bonds.
evalFeedback	6	7	The O of the epoxide is not the electrophilic atom.  The electrophilic atom is <i>attached</i> to the leaving group.
evalFeedback	6	8	The O of the nucleophile should make a bond to the electrophilic atom.  Which atom is that?  (Hint: It is NOT the O of the epoxide!)
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  One of the C atoms of the epoxide participates in an SN2 reaction with H2O as nucleophile, inverting its configuration.

evalFeedback	7	3	Please indicate the configuration of both stereocenters.
evalFeedback	7	4	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	7	5	The ring in the starting material is very strained.  It pops open upon reaction with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	7	6	No C-C or C-H bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	7	The nucleophile will be incorporated into the product, and the leaving group will remain in the product, too, because it is attached to the substrate through <i>two</i> bonds.
evalFeedback	7	8	The O of the epoxide is not the electrophilic atom.  The electrophilic atom is <i>attached</i> to the leaving group.
evalFeedback	7	9	The nucleophile makes a bond to the electrophile, and the leaving group leaves.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles, one of the C-O bonds of the epoxide cleaves, and that C makes a new bond to the nucleophile.  Under basic conditions, the less substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide forms the bond with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	8	2	Which C atom of the epoxide is more likely to be attacked by a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	8	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	8	4	The epoxide ring is opened up by the nucleophile, so the product doesn't contain a ring.
evalFeedback	8	5	No C-C or C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	6	When an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile, one of the C-O bonds breaks.  What functional group is present in the product?
evalFeedback	8	7	Because the leaving group remains tethered to the product, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials.
qStmt	9		Even though elimination will predominate, draw the substitution product.
evalFeedback	9	1	Correct! <i>t</i>-Butoxide acts as a nucleophile and replaces the Br atom in <i>n</i>-butyl bromide to give an ether.
evalFeedback	9	2	Even though elimination will predominate, draw the substitution product.
evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	9	5	K is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	9	6	Br acts as a leaving group in substitution reactions.
evalFeedback	9	7	No C-C or C-H bonds are likely to be broken or made in this reaction.
evalFeedback	9	8	Which atom is nucleophilic?  Which is electrophilic?  Join them.
evalFeedback	9	9	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the leaving group and the nucleophile's counterion.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  Epoxides are electrophilic, and the C attached to Li is nucleophilic.  An SN2 reaction will occur at the less substituted C of the epoxide, breaking one of the C-O bonds.  The other C-O bond is retained.  Aqueous workup gives the alcohol.
evalFeedback	10	2	Under these basic conditions, which C atom of the epoxide is more likely to be attacked by the nucleophile?
evalFeedback	10	3	Please draw the neutral product that is obtained after workup.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	10	5	After workup, the Li atom in the organic product is replaced with H, so there is no Li in the organic product.
evalFeedback	10	6	All the C-C bonds in the starting materials are present in the products, and no C-H bonds are made or broken.
evalFeedback	10	7	When nucleophiles react with epoxides, what functional group is obtained?
evalFeedback	10	8	In this substitution reaction, because the leaving group is tethered to the product, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials, with the metal Li replaced with H.
evalFeedback	10	9	Draw out the epoxide starting material, along with all C-H bonds in both starting materials, before drawing the product.  No C-H bonds will be made or broken.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right! The peracid <i>meta</i>-chloroperbenzoic acid, ArCO3H, delivers one O atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide.
evalFeedback	11	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	11	3	Please draw only the product derived from the alkene starting material.
evalFeedback	11	4	CH2Cl2 is merely a solvent.  Its elements are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	11	5	mCPBA is an abbreviation for <i>meta</i>chloroperbenzoic acid, or ArCO3H.  Looking at its formula, what element do you think it will deliver to the alkene?
evalFeedback	11	6	Only one O atom is transferred from mCPBA to the alkene.
evalFeedback	11	7	No C-C or C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	11	8	When mCPBA delivers an O atom to the alkene, both C atoms of the alkene make new bonds to the O atom.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  Under acidic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at the more substituted C atom.
evalFeedback	12	2	Under acidic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at the C atom best able to bear a positive charge.
evalFeedback	12	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	12	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	12	5	No C-C or C-H bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	6	What functional group is obtained when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	12	7	In this substitution reaction, because the leaving group is tethered to the electrophile, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles under basic conditions, the less substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide ring reacts with the nucleophile, and the C-O bond of the epoxide breaks to give an alcohol.  The C atom that undergoes substitution inverts its configuration.
evalFeedback	13	2	What happens to the configuration of the C atom that undergoes the substitution reaction?
evalFeedback	13	3	Why would the configuration of the C atom that does <i>not</i> react with the nucleophile change?
evalFeedback	13	4	Please specify the configuration at both stereocenters.
evalFeedback	13	5	Under basic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at which C of the epoxide?
evalFeedback	13	6	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	13	7	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	13	8	No C-C or C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	13	9	The O of the epoxide is not an electrophilic atom, so the nucleophile doesn't make a bond to it.  The O of the epoxide is <i>attached</i> to the electrophilic atoms.
evalFeedback	13	10	What functional group is obtained when epoxides react with nucleophiles?

evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles under acidic conditions, the more substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide ring reacts with the nucleophile, inverting its configuration, and the C-O bond of the epoxide breaks to give an alcohol.

He expected that the product would be a diol (Figure 2).  He did not get any of the expected product.  What product did he get?
evalFeedback	9	1	Excellent! The first reaction is an acid-base reaction.  The Grignard reagent reacts with the H of the OH group to form an alkoxide.  In the second step, addition of dilute HCl protonates the alkoxide formed and also catalyzes the reaction of H2O with the epoxide to give a diol.

The following aziridinium ion (see Figure) reacts wih sodium methoxide to form <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. If a small amount of aqueous Br2 is added to <b>A</b>, the reddish color of Br2 persists, but the color disappears when Br2 is added to <b>B</b>. When the aziridinium ion reacts with methanol, only <b>A</b> is formed. Identify <b>A</b>.
evalFeedback	15	1	Very good! <b>A</b> is the substitution product that is formed by methoxide ion attacking a C atom of the three-membered ring and opening the ring, with the N acting as a leaving group.
evalFeedback	15	2	This elimination product would react with Br2, so the reddish color would disappear.  Methoxide ion can react as a base to give the product you drew.  How else can methoxide react?
evalFeedback	15	3	Your answer must take into account the fact that <B>A</B> is obtained from the reaction of the aziridinium ion with both NaOMe and MeOH.  Although you could argue that the CH3 group attached to N would be electrophilic toward MeO^- under basic conditions because it is so unhindered, it would be hard to make a similar argument about MeOH under acidic conditions.  What other atom in the aziridinium ion is electrophilic?
evalFeedback	15	4	Please draw a neutral product.

When aziridinium ion reacts with methanol, only <b>A</b> is formed. Identify <b>B</b>.
evalFeedback	16	1	Very good! <b>B</b> is the E^2 elimination product, with N acting as a leaving group. The red color of Br2 disappears when it is added to <b>B</b> because Br2 adds to the double bond.

qStmt	1		An organic lab student carried out the reaction of methylmagnesium iodide with acetone (CH3COCH3), followed by aqueous workup. During the distillation to isolate the product, she forgot to mark the vials she used to collect the fractions. She turned in a product of formula C4H10O that boiled at 35 &deg;C. The IR spectrum showed only a weak O-H stretch around 3300 cm^^-1 , and the mass spectrum showed a base peak at <i>m/z</i> 59. The NMR spectrum showed a quartet (<i>J</i> = 7 Hz) of area 2 at 3.5 ppm and a triplet (<i>J</i> = 7 Hz) of area 3 at 1.3 ppm.  Propose a structure for this product.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  This compound has the molecular formula C4H10O, and the MS shows a peak at <i>m/z</i> 59 due to loss of a CH3 group.  The H NMR spectrum shows CH2CH3 bonded to an O atom.  The student isolated diethyl ether, the solvent typically used for Grignard reactions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Your compound doesn't have the molecular formula C4H10O.
evalFeedback	1	3	This compound is the one that would be expected from this reaction, but it has a boiling point aorund 75 &deg;C, and its NMR spectrum does not match the one obtained.
evalFeedback	1	4	Although an alcohol would result from the reaction of methylmagnesium iodide with acetone, its O-H stretch would be a strong peak, not weak as indicated. Sometimes, the weak O-H stretch at 3300 cm^^-1 is due to water contamination. Focus on the NMR spectrum!
evalFeedback	1	5	This compound would not give you the indicated NMR signals. Draw all isomers with C4H10O molecular formula and then try to see which one corresponds to that NMR spectrum.
qStmt	2		An acid-catalyzed reaction was carried out using methyl cellosolve (2-methoxyethanol) as the solvent. When the 2-methoxyethanol was redistilled, a higher-boiling fraction (bp 162 &deg;C) was also recovered. The mass spectrum of this fraction showed the molecular weight to be 134. The IR and NMR spectra appear below. Determine  the structure of this compound.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right! Under acidic conditions, OH becomes a good leaving group, and an OH from another molecule will act as a nucleophile. An ether is formed. This compound corresponds to the IR and NMR spectra.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	3	Your structure does not have a molecular weight of 134.
evalFeedback	2	4	Alcohols usually show a strong absorption at 3300 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum. This peak is absent in your spectrum, so no OH group is present in the compound.
evalFeedback	2	5	What reaction can alcohols undergo under acidic conditions?  Identify a nucleophile and an electrophile and make the right connection.
qStmt	3		A compound of molecular formula C8H8O gives the IR and NMR spectra shown below. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right! This compound has the molecular formula C8H8O and it matches both IR and NMR spectra.
evalFeedback	3	2	Your structure doesn't have the molecular formula of C8H8O.
evalFeedback	3	3	Alcohols usually show a strong, wide peak around 3300 cm^^-1 in IR spectrum. This signal is not present in the indicated spectrum.
evalFeedback	3	4	Carbonyl groups usually show an absorption peak around 1700 cm^^-1 in IR spectrum. This signal is not present in the indicated spectrum.
evalFeedback	3	5	There are no peaks in the 4.6-6 ppm range; this indicates the absence of an alkene.
evalFeedback	3	6	What do the H NMR resonances at 7.2-7.4 ppm signify about one of the substructures in this compound?
evalFeedback	3	7	Make sure your structure matches the indicated IR and NMR spectra.

evalFeedback	3	6	A strong base cannot be employed under acidic reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	3	7	The CH3^+ ion and primary carbocations that are not stabilized by resonance with a heteroatom or a #pi bond are too high in energy to be proposed as intermediates.
evalFeedback	3	8	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.
evalFeedback	3	9	Good! In an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of propylene oxide, the more substituted C is attacked by the nucleophile, leading to inversion of stereochemistry. The regiochemistry of ring opening is dictated by the electronic stability of the transition state.

evalFeedback	6	2	No radicals should be created under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	6	4	The mechanism you have drawn does not produce the specified product.
evalFeedback	6	6	Good Work!  The hydride atom removes a proton from the alcohol, turning it into an alkoxide, which then attacks the tosylate in an SN2 fashion, leaving you with the ether.  This is an example of the Williamson Ether Synthesis.
qStmt	7		Draw a probable mechanism for this transformation. Show electron flow as well.
evalFeedback	7	2	No radicals should be created under the reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	7	4	The mechanism you have drawn does not produce the specified product.
evalFeedback	7	6	Nice Job!  After proton abstraction, an alkoxide is formed, which then displaces the tosylate to give you the ether.  Notice how there is retention of configuration with this particular reaction, because the attack did not take place at the chiral center.
qStmt	8		Draw a reasonable mechanism for the following reaction.

evalFeedback	8	8	No atom in this mechanism should have a total charge of &plusmn;2 or greater.
evalFeedback	8	9	No atom in this mechanism should have a formal positive charge.
evalFeedback	8	10	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	8	11	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	8	12	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed arrow.

evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The Br is replaced by OH by an addition-elimination mechanism (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), and the product tautomerizes to the amide.  The product remains aromatic because of the ^+N=C-O^- resonance form.
evalFeedback	5	2	Almost right.  This compound (which is, after all, an enol) tautomerizes to a more stable form.

In this particular reaction, the leaving group is H.  (The mechanism is not simply addition-elimination with loss of H^- .)  (Neither H2O nor air is considered a starting material for purposes of this calculation.)
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The most nucleophilic C in furan is adjacent to the O atom.  Draw resonance structures of the starting material to see why.
evalFeedback	7	2	What is the normal regiochemistry of furan substitution?  Draw the different cationic intermediates and their resonance structures to see which is lowest in energy.

evalFeedback	8	13	In this aromatic substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of H and the leaving group of the electrophile.  (FeCl3 is a catalyst, not a starting material.)
evalFeedback	8	14	This reaction forms a C-Cl bond.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  The NH2^- deprotonates the CH3 group, turning it into a nucleophile, and it undergoes SN2 substitution with the alkyl bromide to give the product.

evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	9	5	This compound has a particularly acidic C atom, so ^-NH2 acts as a base, not as a nucleophile.  The elements of ^-NH2 are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	6	Br is a leaving group, so it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	7	The aromatic nucleus remains intact.
evalFeedback	9	8	All the aromatic C-H bonds remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	9	9	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of H and the leaving group of the electrophile.  (NH2^- is a base, not a starting material.)
evalFeedback	10	1	Right! Step 1 makes the Grignard reagent, step 2 makes the new C-C bond, step 3 neutralizes the product.

qStmt	2		Give the major product of the reaction after aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  Substitution preferentially takes place at C^2 of pyrrole rather than C^3 because the cationic intermediate obtained with C^2 substitution has more resonance forms.

evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	4	Please draw a single organic product.

qStmt	4		Give the major product of the reaction after aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  An SN2 reaction occurs to replace the C-Br bond with a C-N bond.  However, the product 2&deg; amine is more reactive than the starting 1&deg; amine, so a second SN2 reaction occurs to give a 3&deg; amine.
evalFeedback	4	2	Almost perfect.  An SN2 reaction does occur to replace the C-Br bond with a C-N bond.  However, the product is more reactive than the starting material, so a further reaction is likely to occur.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The NO2 group is attached to C^5 on the furan ring because of the relatively stable carbocation intermediate formed after the electrophilic substitution.

evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	In this aromatic substitution reaction, the thiophene nucleus is retained intact and aromatic.

qStmt	8		Give the major product of the reaction.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  The N atom in the pyridine is alkylated.  The N atom present on the pyridine is not alkylated, since its lone pair is delocalized into the pyridine ring and is not available to react with the alkyl halide.
evalFeedback	8	2	The ring N atom has an incorrect formal charge.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw a single organic product, either as a salt or a cation.
evalFeedback	8	4	The I atom acts merely as a leaving group.  It is not covalently attached to any atom in the product.
evalFeedback	8	5	All of the #sigma and #pi bonds in the starting aromatic compound (including C-H bonds) are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	8	6	In this substitution reaction, because the nucleophilic atom is uncharged and does not bear an acidic H, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.  The leaving group becomes a counterion which may or may not be included in the formula.
evalFeedback	8	7	Which N is most nucleophilic?  Draw the second-best resonance structure to find out.
evalFeedback	8	8	The organic compound in your answer does not have the correct charge.
qStmt	9		Give the major product of the reaction after aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good! The O atom attacks the P in an SN2 reaction, displacing Cl^- , which then returns to displace O from the ring in an addition-elimination reaction.
evalFeedback	9	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	3	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Although an intermediate contains P, the final organic product does not.
evalFeedback	9	5	The P-O bond is extremely strong.  If there is no P in the product, would there be any O in it?
evalFeedback	9	6	What atom replaces the O on the pyridine ring?
evalFeedback	9	7	In this aromatic substitution reaction, no C-C or C-H bonds are made or broken, and the pyridine nucleus is retained intact and aromatic.  (The starting material may not look aromatic, but draw a good resonance structure to see it.)
evalFeedback	9	8	The O is replaced with Cl, the pyridine ring is retained aromatic, and the product is neutral.
qStmt	10		Give the major product of the reaction after aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  In step 1, the amine is oxidized to an amine oxide.  In step 2, the amine oxide undergoes Hofmann elimination to give the alkene.
evalFeedback	10	2	Good!  In step 1, the amine is oxidized to an amine oxide.  In step 2, the amine oxide undergoes Hofmann elimination to give the alkene.
evalFeedback	10	3	Yes, but please draw the other product of the reaction.
evalFeedback	10	4	This compound is obtained after step 1.  What effect does the change to an amine oxide have on the C-N bonds?  What kind of reaction could occur in step 2?

qStmt	11		Give the major product of the reaction after workup.  The product should have the same charge as the starting material.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  The electron-withdrawing N causes the #a-C atoms at C^2 and C^4 of the ring to be acidic.  An H atom can be removed by a base, and the resulting carbanion can react with an electrophile.  Workup then gives the monocationic product.
evalFeedback	11	2	The <i>N</i>-methyl group is not the most acidic one.  The better C to deprotonate is the one for which a low-energy resonance can be drawn.
evalFeedback	11	3	The +1 charge of the starting material is unchanged in the product.
evalFeedback	11	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	11	5	All of the C-C and C-N bonds in the starting material are retained in the product, and the pyridine nucleus is retained intact and aromatic.

evalFeedback	12	2	Don't draw the gaseous by-product ethane.
evalFeedback	12	3	Please draw only the N-containing product.
evalFeedback	12	4	No C-C or C-H bonds are made or broken in the pyrrole portion, and the pyrrole nucleus remains aromatic.
evalFeedback	12	5	Mg and Br hang together and are inseparable.
evalFeedback	12	6	The Grignard reagent is nucleophilic at C.  The N of pyrrole is nucleophilic.  Why would they make a bond?
qStmt	13		Give the major product of the reaction after aqueous workup.
evalFeedback	13	1	Excellent!  In step 1, the amine is converted to the amine oxide.  In step 2, a Hofmann elimination occurs.  The Hofmann elimination requires that the O-H and C=C bonds form at the same time as the C-N bond cleaves, so the most likely position for the new C=C #pi bond is from the former methylene C of the ethyl group to the former methine C.
evalFeedback	13	2	Your answer is quite reasonable, but the requirement of the Hofmann elimination for a cyclic transition state in which the new O-H and C=C #pi bonds form at the same time as the N-C bond cleaves suggests that a different, more conformationally free CH2 group should have its H removed.
evalFeedback	13	3	What configuration is the C=C bond expected to have?
evalFeedback	13	4	This compound is obtained after step 1.  What effect does the change to an amine oxide have on the C-N bonds?  What kind of reaction could occur in step 2?

evalFeedback	13	10	The formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of H and the leaving group from the electrophile in step 1.
evalFeedback	13	11	In step 1, the N atom reacts with H2O2 and gains a positive charge.  What effect does this change have on the N-containing functional group?  What kind of reaction could occur in step 2?
qStmt	14		Draw only the N-containing product of this reaction.
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  E^2 elimination occurs, with the regioselectivity determined  by Hofmann's rule (removing the H from the least substituted #b-C atom) to give the tertiary amine that you have drawn.
evalFeedback	14	2	When tetraalkylammonium ions undergo elimination, the H is removed from the less substituted C atom, not from the more substituted one.
evalFeedback	14	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	14	5	Please draw the N-containing product of this reaction.
evalFeedback	14	6	HO^- acts as a base.  It is not incorporated into an organic product.

qStmt	1		Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aziridines in the presence of a Lewis acid such as AlCl3.  Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Excellent!  In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, AlCl3 complexes to the N of the aziridine, and benzene attacks the more substituted C atom to which the N is attached.
evalFeedback	1	2	Under acidic conditions, the ring C atom attached to N that is better able to accommodate a carbocation is preferentially attacked by the benzene.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	1	5	AlCl3 acts as a Lewis acid.  Its elements are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	1	6	The product retains a benzene ring.
evalFeedback	1	7	The N-CH3 bond present in the starting material is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	1	8	All of the C-C and C-H bonds in the aziridine are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	1	9	Which atom of the aziridine has reactivity that is complementary to benzene?  (Hint: It's the one attached to the leaving group.)
evalFeedback	1	10	After one of the ring C atoms is attacked by the electrophile and a C-N bond is cleaved, the N atom has only two C atoms attached.
evalFeedback	1	11	In this aromatic substitution reaction, because the leaving group is tethered to the electrophilic atom, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.  (AlCl3 is a catalyst, not a starting material.)
qStmt	2		A Hofmann degradation of a primary amine forms an alkene that gives butanal and 2-methylpropanal upon ozonolysis and workup under reducing conditions.  Identify the amine.
evalFeedback	2	1	Excellent!  Butanal and 2-methylpropanal are derived from ozonolysis of 2-methyl-3-heptene.  The primary amine from which this alkene might be generated by Hofmann elimination is generated by addition of H-NH2 across the alkene.  The starting primary amine could in principle be either 2-methyl-3-heptanamine or 2-methyl-4-heptanamine, but Hofmann elimination from the latter would lead to a mixture of regioisomers, whereas Hofmann elimination from the former would lead only to the target regioisomer (disubstituted rather than trisubstituted alkene).
evalFeedback	2	2	Hofmann degradation of this amine could give two different alkene regioisomers, which on ozonolysis give four different products.  What other amine is likely to give only the desired alkene upon Hofmann elimination?
evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	2	4	Please draw a single organic compound.
evalFeedback	2	5	The starting material is a primary amine.
evalFeedback	2	6	The starting amine does not contain a C=C bond.  The C=C bond is generated upon Hofmann elimination.
evalFeedback	2	7	The starting amine would have had a C-C bond between the carbonyl C atoms of what became the ozonolysis products.
evalFeedback	2	8	The starting compound has no functional groups other than the primary amine.
evalFeedback	2	9	The NH2 group must be attached to one of the C atoms that becomes a C(sp2) upon Hofmann elimination and then becomes a carbonyl C upon ozonolysis.
Topic: Heterocycles and amines; Set: Skraup synthesis
qStmt	1		Quinolines (see Figure for the parent compound) are commonly synthesized by a method known as the Skraup synthesis, which involves the reaction of aniline with glycerol under acidic conditions. Nitrobenzene is added to the reaction mixture to serve as an oxidizing agent. The first step in the synthesis is the dehydration of glycerol to propenal.  What product would be obtained if <i>para</i>-ethylaniline were used instead of aniline?

evalFeedback	1	7	The 1,4-relationship between the Et group and the N on the benzene ring remains unchanged in the quinoline product.
qStmt	2		Quinolines (see Figure for the parent compound) are commonly synthesized by a method known as the Skraup synthesis, which involves the reaction of aniline with glycerol under acidic conditions. Nitrobenzene is added to the reaction mixture to serve as an oxidizing agent. The first step in the synthesis is the dehydration of glycerol to propenal.  What product would be obtained if 3-hexen-2-one were used instead of glycerol?
evalFeedback	2	1	Excellent! The #a,#b-unsaturated ketone undergoes conjugate addition with aniline, followed by electrophilic aromatic substitution, dehydration, and oxidation.  Because the first step is the conjugate addition, the Et group ends up in the 2-position of the quinoline, and the Me group ends up in the 4-position.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your answer is reasonable, but incorrect.  When aniline initially reacts with 3-hexen-2-one, it undergoes a conjugate addition reaction.  Where would this place the Et and Me groups relative to the N on the pyridine ring?
evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	2	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	2	5	The product is a substituted quinoline.

evalFeedback	2	9	All of the C-C bonds of the starting materials are retained in the product.
qStmt	3		Quinolines are commonly synthesized by a method known as the Skraup synthesis, which involves the reaction of aniline with glycerol under acidic conditions. Nitrobenzene is added to the reaction mixture to serve as an oxidizing agent. The first step in the synthesis is the dehydration of glycerol to propenal.  What two starting materials are needed for the synthesis of 2,7-diethyl-3-methylquinoline (shown)?
evalFeedback	3	1	Excellent! To arrive at the starting materials, the quinoline is disconnected at the N-C^2 and the C^4-C^4a bonds; C^4 gains a double bond to O, and C2-C3 becomes a double bond.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw neutral starting materials.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw two starting materials.
evalFeedback	3	4	The number of C atoms in the two starting materials should equal the number of C atoms in the product.

evalFeedback	3	7	Disconnect the quinoline at the N-C^2 and the C^4-C^4a bonds; C^4 gains a double bond to O, and C2-C3 becomes a double bond.
evalFeedback	3	8	If this compound were the starting material, the product would be 4-ethyl-3-methylquinoline, not 2-ethyl-3-methylquinoline.  The first step of the Skraup synthesis is conjugate addition of the aniline N to the #a,#b-unsaturated carbonyl compound.  Which substituent in the product should be attached to the #b-C of the starting #a,#b-unsaturated carbonyl compound?

evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw the structure of citronellal properly.
evalFeedback	1	4	You've put one 13C in the right place, but how many equivalents of mevalonic acid are incorporated into citronellal?  So how many 13C atoms should be incorporated?
evalFeedback	1	5	One or both of the 13C atoms are in the wrong positions.
evalFeedback	1	6	How many equivalents of mevalonic acid are incorporated into citronellal?  So how many 13C atoms should be incorporated?
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The labelled CO2^- group is lost in the biosynthesis, so the product citronellal is unlabelled.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw citronellal correctly.
evalFeedback	2	3	What happens to the COO^- group when mevalonic acid is converted to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which are used to prepare citronellal?
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The 13C will appear not only at position 4 but in <i>both</i> terminal Me groups, because in the biosynthesis, when the double bond is introduced, the CH2OH group can end up cis <i>or</i> trans to the labelled C atom.  The labelling of all three positions does not suggest that all of the molecules actually contain three 13C atoms.  Rather, it shows that the <i>entire sample</i> of citronellal isolated from the lemons contains some 13C in all three positions.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw citronellal properly.
evalFeedback	3	3	The citronellal should contain 13C.
evalFeedback	3	4	You have correctly labelled one position, but you more need labels.
evalFeedback	3	5	The 13C is in the wrong position, and the product has 13C in more than one position.
evalFeedback	3	6	Positions 4 and 8 are labelled correctly, but a third position should also be labelled.  The 13C atom in the starting material can end up not only at C^8, but also at what other position?
evalFeedback	3	7	Positions 4 and 9 are labelled correctly, but a third position should also be labelled.  The 13C atom in the starting material can end up not only at C^8, but also at what other position?
evalFeedback	3	8	One of the two equivalents of mevalonic acid that is incorporated into citronellal indeed places its 13C into both positions 8 and 9 of the product.  Into which position does the 13C from the <i>second</i> equivalent of mevalonic acid incorporate?
evalFeedback	3	9	One or more of the 13C atoms is in the wrong position.
evalFeedback	3	10	You have incorporated too many 13C atoms into the product.

qStmt	1		An optically active monoterpene (A) with formula C10H18O is hydrogenated to give compound B with formula C10H20O. When B is heated with acid, compound C is obtained with formula C10H18. When C is ozonolyzed and worked up with Zn, 4-methylcyclohexanone is obtained. Draw A. (More than one answer is possible. How many rings and double bonds must A have?)
evalFeedback	1	1	Right.  The formula says there are two degrees of unsaturation.  The hydrogenation says there is one #pi bond, and with the knowledge that A is a monoterpene, we know that the skeleton is 4-methyl-1-isopropylcyclohexane.  Heating B with acid and losing H2O suggests the one O is an alcohol.  Ozonolyzing C tells us the OH group must have been #a to the ring along with three C atoms.  Optical activity means the compound must be chiral.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Your compound is not C10H18O.
evalFeedback	1	5	How many rings and #pi bonds must C10H18O have?  If hydrogenation gives C10H20O, how many rings must it have, and how many #pi bonds?
evalFeedback	1	6	If hydrogenation of A gives B with two more H atoms, what functional group must be present in A?
evalFeedback	1	7	A monocyclic monoterpene must have its ten C atoms arranged in a particular way.  Look up the structure of menthol if you don't know how the C atoms are arranged.
evalFeedback	1	8	Treatment of B with acid results in the loss of H2O.  What functional group must be present in B (and A)?
evalFeedback	1	9	Elimination of H2O from B is facile, but elimination of H2O from primary and secondary alcohols is quite slow.
evalFeedback	1	10	If the OH group were in the ring, then elimination of H2O would give a cyclohexene as C, and ozonolysis of a cyclohexene would not give 4-methylcyclohexanone.
evalFeedback	1	11	This compound is achiral, but A is optically active.

qStmt	12		When an extract of parsley seed is saponified and acidified, one of the fatty acids isolated is <i>petroselenic acid</i>, formula C18H34O2. Hydrogenation of petroselenic acid gives pure stearic acid. When petroselenic acid is treated with warm KMnO4 followed by acidification, the only organic products are dodecanoic acid and adipic acid. The NMR spectrum shows absorptions of vinyl protons split by coupling constants of 7 Hz and 10 Hz. Propose a structure for petroselenic acid.
evalFeedback	12	1	Correct!  The hydrogenation result indicates that the compound is a straight-chain carboxylic acid.  The formula indicates that the compound has two degrees of unsaturation; one is the carbonyl group, so the other must be a double bond.  The products of KMnO4 oxidation indicate the location of the alkene. The 10 Hz coupling constant indicates that the double bond is cis (a trans double bond would have <i>J</i> = ca. 15 Hz). The 7 Hz coupling is from each C(sp2)-H to the neighboring C(sp3)-H atoms.

evalFeedback	5	1	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	5	2	What does the odd mass of the molecular ion suggest about the structure of this compound?
evalFeedback	5	3	What must be the mass of your compound?
evalFeedback	5	4	That's an excellent answer, but it's not the right answer. Can you account for a fragmentation that will cause loss of 29 amu? (The peak at 45 amu is M + H &#8211; 29.)
evalFeedback	5	5	What substructure does the peak at 58 amu suggest is present in this compound?
evalFeedback	5	6	Good! With a mass of 73, there must be one N, which leaves 59, which corresponds to C4H11. The compound C4H11N has &Omega; = 0. The prominent fragmentation peak at 58 corresponds to loss of CH3, which is most likely if an Et group is attached to N.

evalFeedback	6	6	What substructure does the peak at 44 amu suggest is present in this compound?
evalFeedback	6	7	Good! With a mass of 73, there must be one N, which leaves 59, which corresponds to C4H11. The compound C4H11N has &Omega; = 0. The prominent fragmentation peak at 44 corresponds to loss of CH2CH3, which is most likely if an N-C-Et group is present. The actual answer is NH2CH(CH3)Et, but other answers, such as MeNHPr and EtCONH2, are also reasonable.
qStmt	7		Consider the following MS. The two heaviest peaks have heights of 258 and 24 counts, respectively. Write a formula consistent with this information.
evalFeedback	7	1	What should be the exact mass of your formula?
evalFeedback	7	2	How many C atoms must be present in the compound, given the information in the spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	3	Try doing an isobaric substitution, such as replacing H12 with C, or CH4 with O.
evalFeedback	7	4	You have the right number of C atoms based on the ratio of the M+1 peak to the M^+ peak. What other common element could be present?
evalFeedback	7	5	Your formula is not consistent with the data given. Try again.
evalFeedback	7	9	Your answer is not unreasonable based on the M^+ and M+1 peaks, but the fragmentation pattern definitely rules it out.
evalFeedback	7	10	Good! 24/258 = 9.3%, which is most consistent with eight C atoms and one O atom. C8O weighs 112, which leaves sixteen H to make up the mass to 128. C8H16O is a reasonable formula with &Omega; = 1.
qStmt	8		An unknown compund gives the MS spectrum shown. The three heaviest peaks have relative intensities of 75.0%, 4.0%, and 3.5% &#177; 0.5%. Propose a structure for the compound.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good! The M+1 and M+2 peaks imply C4S, suggesting a formula of C4H10S. The prominent loss of CH3 due to #b-scission suggests an Et group attached to S.
evalFeedback	8	2	Good try. This compound would be expected to give an M&#8211;15 peak, but the M&#8211;29 peak would be much larger (because it would give a more substituted carbocation).
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	8	5	You have the right formula. Now you need to determine the correct structure. The prominent peak at 75 amu is probably due to #b-scission. What group attached to S would undergo #b-scission to give a fragment with this weight?
evalFeedback	8	6	The mass of your compound is correct, but the size of the M+1 and M+2 peaks aren't consistent with it.
evalFeedback	8	7	Which peak is the molecular ion? How much must your compound weigh?

Topic: MS, IR, elemental analysis; Set: MS and IR problems
qStmt	1		Determine the structure of the compound that gives rise to the following mass and IR spectra.  Note: The IR spectrum is scaled incorrectly.  Subtract 30 cm^^-1 from the value of each absorbance.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  The molecular weight is 100, the substance contains a ketone, the large M-15 peak suggests it's a methyl ketone, and the M-29 and M-42 peaks suggest it's a butyl ketone.
evalFeedback	1	2	This answer is very good, but not correct.  The compound you have drawn, 2-methyl-3-pentanone, has a spectrum that is similar, but the peak at 85 amu is much smaller, and the peak at 58 amu is much larger.
evalFeedback	1	3	Look at the mass of the molecular ion. What should be the exact mass of your compound?
evalFeedback	1	4	The IR spectrum has an absorbance in the 1700-1750 cm^^-1 range. What functional group does this absorbance signify?
evalFeedback	1	5	The IR spectrum shows an absorbance slightly below 1400 cm^^-1 , and the mass spectrum shows a peak at [M - 15]. What group do these data signify?
evalFeedback	1	6	1,3-Diketones have a strong tendency to tautomerize (isomerize by shifting an H atom) to their enol form; in this case, CH3C(=O)CH=C(OH)CH3.  As a result, this compound would show a strong IR absorbance around 3300 cm^^-1.  Moreover, this compound would not show a peak at [M - 29] (loss of Et) in the MS.  <p>Why do you think there are two ketones in this compound?
evalFeedback	1	7	The mass spectrum shows a peak at [M - 29]. What group does this information signify?
evalFeedback	1	8	Carboxylic acids show very strong, broad absorbances at 2700-3400 cm^^-1 .  Does the IR spectrum have this feature?
evalFeedback	1	9	An ester would show an absorbance around 1740 cm^^-1 , not 1710 cm^^-1 as above.  (Remember to subtract 30 cm^^-1 from each absorbance!)  Also, esters show several strong absorbances in the 1100-1250 cm^^-1 region, not just one as in the spectrum shown.
evalFeedback	1	10	Alcohols show very strong, broad absorbances at 3500 cm^^-1 .
evalFeedback	1	11	An aldehyde would show a sharp absorbance at about 2700 cm^^-1 .
evalFeedback	1	12	Very close. However, the presence of the ion at 58 amu suggests that the compound is a methyl ketone. (This ion is due to a McLafferty rearrangement that affords CH3C(=OH)CH2^+.)
evalFeedback	1	13	This compound would show a large peak at [M - 28] due to a McLafferty rearrangement (loss of Et, gain of H).  No such peak is seen.  The correct answer must not have branching #a to the carbonyl.
evalFeedback	1	14	This is a very good answer, but it's not right.  1,2-Diketones have a strong tendency to tautomerize (isomerize by shifting an H atom) to their enol form; in this case, CH3C(=O)C(OH)=CHCH3.  As a result, this compound would show a strong IR absorbance around 3300 cm^^-1.  <p>Why do you think there are two ketones in this compound?
qStmt	2		Determine the structure of the compound that gives rise to the following mass and IR spectra.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The mass is 162, and the M+2 peak suggests one Br is present.  The IR shows no functional groups, so the formula of the molecule is best formulated as C6H11Br.  One degree of unsaturation, but with no sign of C(sp2)-H or C=C stretches in the IR, the compound is best described as cyclic.  With no M-15 peak, the simplest answer is bromocyclohexane.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your answer is quite reasonable, but the intensity of the [M - Br] peak suggests that the correct answer has its C atoms arranged as symmetrically as possible.
evalFeedback	2	3	What does the 1:1 ratio of the peaks at 162 and 164 amu suggest about the elemental composition of this compound?
evalFeedback	2	4	Your answer weighs 164 amu, but the molecular ion is found at 162 amu.  The peak at 164 amu is the [M + 2] peak.
evalFeedback	2	5	The <b>exact</b> molecular weight, not the average molecular weight, should be 162.  Use the weights of the most abundant isotopes to calculate the exact molecular weight.
evalFeedback	2	6	Look at the molecular ion.  What should be the molecular weight of your compound?
evalFeedback	2	7	The fingerprint region of the IR spectrum does not show the strong absorbances that would indicate a C-O or C-N bond.  Try again.
evalFeedback	2	8	Although it is remotely possible that the compound is an alkene, the lack of any C(sp2)-H or C=C absorbances in the IR makes it unlikely.
qStmt	3		Determine the structure of the compound that gives rise to the following mass and IR spectra.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  The IR spectrum (1735, 2740 cm^^-1 ) suggests an aldehyde.  With a mass of 72, that means C4H8O.  If the compound were isobutyraldehyde, the M-28 peak due to the McLafferty rearrangement would not be so high.
evalFeedback	3	2	Your answer is quite reasonable, but the large [M - 28] peak at 44 amu in the MS suggests that the compound is capable of undergoing a McLafferty rearrangement, which suggests that it has a chain that is at least 4 C atoms long.  Try again.
evalFeedback	3	3	Look at the mass of the molecular ion. What should be the molecular weight of your compound?
evalFeedback	3	4	The IR spectrum has an absorbance at 1735 cm^^-1 . What functional group does this absorbance signify?
evalFeedback	3	5	Yes, the structure should have a carbonyl group, but what does the absorbance at 2740 cm^^-1 tell you about what kind of carbonyl group should be present?
qStmt	4		Draw a structure consistent with the following data:
<ul>
<li>The MS shows a molecular ion at 59 amu. 
<li>The only absorbances in the functional group region of the IR spectrum are a double-humped strong absorbance at around 3300 cm^^-1 and a few absorbances at 2800&#8211;3000 cm^^-1. A single absorbance at about 1385 cm^^-1 is also observed.
</ul>
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  The double-humped IR absorbance suggests a primary amine, and a molecular weight of 59 suggests C3H9N.  Isopropylamine would have a double peak at 1385 cm^^-1 .
evalFeedback	4	2	Close, but this compound would have a double peak at 1385 cm^^-1 .  Try again.
evalFeedback	4	3	The molecular weight is odd. What does this fact tell you about the elemental composition?
evalFeedback	4	4	What should be the molecular weight of the answer?
evalFeedback	4	5	What does the double-humped strong absorbance at around 3300 cm^^-1 tell you about the functionality in this compound?
qStmt	5		The IR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C5H8O was obtained in CCl4 and is shown in the figure. Identify the compound.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct!  The IR shows a C=O and no C=C or C(sp2)-H, so the compound is a ketone, and the additional degree of unsaturation is from a ring.  The unusually high-energy absorbance for a ketone (1750 cm^^-1 ) suggests that the ketone is in a five-membered ring.
evalFeedback	5	2	That's not C5H8O.
evalFeedback	5	3	The lack of any C(sp2)-H or C=C absorbances suggests that the compound is not an alkene.
evalFeedback	5	4	The absence of an absorbance around 2750 cm^^-1 suggests this compound is not an aldehyde.
evalFeedback	5	5	What functional group does the absorbance at 1750 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	5	6	The unusually high-energy IR absorbance for a ketone suggests that the ketone is in a ring.
evalFeedback	5	7	If the ketone were in a ring that small, its absorbance would be even higher in energy than it already is!
qStmt	6		An unknown, foul-smelling hydrocarbon gives the mass spectrum and IR spectrum shown below.  Use the mass spectrum to propose a structure.  (There is more than one correct answer.)
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  A hydrocarbon with molecular ion of 110 must have the formula C8H14, and the IR absorbances at 3300 and 2120 cm^^-1 indicate that the compound is a terminal alkyne.
evalFeedback	6	2	What are the only elements present in a hydrocarbon?
evalFeedback	6	3	What should the exact mass of your compound be?
evalFeedback	6	4	What is the significance of the IR absorbance at 2120 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	6	5	What is the significance of the IR absorbance at 3300 cm^^-1 ?
qStmt	7		An unknown, foul-smelling hydrocarbon gives the mass spectrum and IR spectrum shown below. Hydrogenation of this compound gives <i>n</i>-octane. Propose a structure for this compound.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  The absorbance at 2120 cm^^-1 signifies that a carbon-carbon triple bond is present. Also, the sharp peak at 3300 cm^^-1 indicates a H atom on an alkyne, so the alkyne is at the one end of the molecule. The hydrogenation of the compound gives <i>n</i>-octane; that means that the chain is linear so the mystery compound is 1-octyne.
evalFeedback	7	2	What elements are present in a hydrocarbon?
evalFeedback	7	3	Where does an alkene have its absorbance peak? Is it present in your IR spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	4	Cycloalkanes usually are not distinguishable in IR.
evalFeedback	7	5	What does the peak at 2120 cm^^-1 signify? What functional group is responsible for this signal?
evalFeedback	7	6	What do the absorbances at 3300 and 2120 cm^^-1 signify? What functional group is present in the compound?
evalFeedback	7	7	Would hydrogenation of your response give <i>n</i>-octane?

qdText	8	3	increase
qdText	8	4	resonance stabilization
qdText	8	5	intermolecular hydrogen bonding
qdText	8	6	hydrophobic interactions

Topic: MS, IR, elemental analysis; Set: MS, IR word problems
qStmt	1		A compound gives a mass spectrum with peaks at <i>m/z</i> = 77 (40%), 112 (100%), 114 (33%), and essentially no other peaks.  Identify the compound.
evalFeedback	1	1	Excellent! The M+2 peak is ~30% of the abundance of the M peak, indicating that the compound has one Cl atom.  The peak at <i>m/z</i> = 77 is due to loss of the Cl atom.  Its mass and the fact that the <i>m/z</i> = 77 peak does not fragment further indicates that it is a benzene ring.
evalFeedback	1	2	What does the 3:1 ratio of the peaks at 112 and 114 amu suggest about the elemental composition of this compound?
evalFeedback	1	3	Your answer weighs 114 amu, but the molecular ion is found at 112 amu.  The peak at 114 amu is the [M + 2] peak.
evalFeedback	1	4	Look at the molecular ion.  What should be the molecular weight of your compound?
evalFeedback	1	5	The peak at <i>m/z</i> = 77 does not fragment.  What does this fact and its mass suggest about its structure?
qStmt	2		While organizing the undergraduate stockroom, a new chemistry professor found a half-gallon jug containing a cloudy liquid (bp 100-105 &deg;C), marked only "STUDENT PREP". She ran a quick mass spectrum, which is shown below. As soon as she saw the spectrum (without even checking the actual mass numbers), she said, "I know what it is."  What compound is the "student prep"?
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! The pair of peaks at M and M+2 of approximately equal heights is characteristic of a bromine compound. Loss of Br gives a mass of 57, C4H9, a butyl group. The peaks at 107 (loss of 29, C2H5) and 93 (loss of 43, C3H7) are consistent with a linear chain, not a branched chain.
evalFeedback	2	2	What is the most obvious feature of the mass spectrum? Look at the pair of peaks at M and M+2.
evalFeedback	2	3	The exact mass is not 138, because 138 is the M+2 peak.
evalFeedback	2	4	What should be the exact mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	2	5	Besides a Br atom, the compound contains only C and H atoms.
evalFeedback	2	6	This compound would not show a large M-29 peak because it lacks a CH3CH2 group.
evalFeedback	2	7	This compound would not show an M-43 peak because it lacks a CH3CH2CH2 group.
qStmt	3		A laboratory student added 1-bromobutane to a flask containing dry ether and Mg turnings. An exothermic reaction resulted, and the ether boiled vigorously for several minutes. Then she added acetone to the reaction mixture, and the ether boiled even more vigorously. She added dilute acid to the mixture, and separated the layers. She evaporated the ether layer, and distilled a liquid that boiled at 143 &deg;C. GC-MS analysis of the distillate showed one major product with a few minor impurities. The mass spectrum of the major product is shown below.  Show the structure of this major product.
evalFeedback	3	1	Correct! The Grignard reagent that is formed will attack acetone forming 1,1-dimethyl-1-pentanol. The exact mass of this tertiary alcohol is 116, but the molecular ion is not visible in the MS spectrum. When a methyl group attached to the quaternary C atom is lost, a very stable carbocation is formed (mass of 101).
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	3	The peak at 101 is not the molecular ion, so your compound should not have a mass of 101.  (If it were 101, it would have to contain an odd number of N atoms, and no N was added to the reaction mixture.)
evalFeedback	3	4	Neither Br nor Mg are present in the final organic product. Mg is replaced with H in the aqueous workup step.
evalFeedback	3	5	Your compound should have as many C atoms as the starting materials (1-bromobutane and acetone) have.
evalFeedback	3	6	When treated with a Grignard reagent, a ketone is converted to what functional group?
evalFeedback	3	7	In step 1, the 1-bromobutane is converted into a Grignard reagent, a nucleophile.  In step 2, acetone, an electrophile, is added.  What reaction will occur between these two substances?
qStmt	4		A graduate student was following a procedure to make 3-propyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene. During the workup procedure, his research advisor called him into her office. By the time he returned to his bench, the product had warmed to a higher temperature than recommended. He isolated the product, which gave the appropriate C(sp2)-H stretch in the IR, but the C=C stretch appeared around 1630 cm^^-1 as opposed to the literature value of 1650 cm^^-1 for the desired product. The mass spectrum showed the correct molecular weight, but the base peak was M &ndash; 29 rather than at M &ndash; 43 as expected. <P>Draw the structure of the actual compound isolated by the student.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right! The lower-energy absorption at 1630 cm^^-1 suggests a conjugated alkene rather than an unconjugated one. The base peak at M &ndash; 29 corresponds to loss of an ethyl group by #b-scission.  The higher temperature allowed for migration of the double bond.
evalFeedback	4	2	Although this compound matches the IR and MS data, its formation requires migration of <i>both</i> #pi bonds in the desired compound.  What compound that matches the data could be obtained from migration of <i>one</i> #pi bond?
evalFeedback	4	3	No, this is the product that the student wanted to obtain. Because of the high temperature, something happened to this compound, and the student actually got a different compound with the C=C stretch at a lower value.
evalFeedback	4	4	The actual product and the desired product have the same formula.
evalFeedback	4	5	The alkene is still present.
evalFeedback	4	6	No C-C single bonds are broken or formed when 3-propyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene is heated more than recommended.
evalFeedback	4	7	This compound would still have the base peak at M &ndash; 43 due to breaking of the propyl radical.
evalFeedback	4	8	What should be the arrangement of the two double bonds so that an absorption at 1630 cm^^-1 be observed, lower than the expected 1650 cm^^-1 ?

qStmt	4		Draw the curved arrows in the box on the left that describe the changes in bonding in this reaction. This exercise looks identical to the previous one, but it behaves a little differently.
evalFeedback	4	1	Do not change the structures of the starting materials or products.
evalFeedback	4	2	The S is making the bond to the electrophilic C atom, but the electron-flow arrow that you drew is connecting the Na and the electrophilic C atom -- note the dashed faint blue line.

qStmt	8		Draw the curved arrows in the box on the left that describe the changes in bonding in this reaction. Two points about this exercise:

<ul>
<li>In the first box, the O that needs to make the bond to H is not showing any lone pairs. That's because it's part of a shortcut group, OMe. To reveal the O atom with its lone pairs, you need to ungroup the shortcut group. Right- or control-click on the OMe group and choose <b>Ungroup and clean</b>.
<li>TsOH is a very strong acid. Also in the first box, Marvin won't let you point an electron-flow arrow to the TsO group (or any other shortcut group), so you will have to either right- or control-click on the TsO group and choose <b>Ungroup and clean</b>, or replace TsO with just O and then attach a Ts group to the O.

evalFeedback	11	4	Good!
qStmt	12		Draw the curved arrows in the box on the left that describe the changes in bonding in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	1	Do not change the structures of the starting materials or products.
evalFeedback	12	3	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons. There is a way to draw the electron-flow arrows that uses fewer of them.
evalFeedback	12	4	Good!
qStmt	13		Draw the curved arrows in the box on the left that describe the changes in bonding in this reaction. Note that the nucleophile is the resonance structure of the nucleophile in the previous exercise, so an additional electron-flow arrow is required.
evalFeedback	13	1	Do not change the structures of the starting materials or products.
evalFeedback	13	2	The new C-C bond is forming between the right-hand C of the alkene and the C of the electrophile, but the electron-flow arrow that you drew to show this is connecting the left-hand C of the alkene with the C of the electrophile -- note the dashed faint blue line. Click the electron-flow arrow button, then click once on the misdirected arrow so that the dashed faint blue line connects the right-hand C and the electrophilic C.
evalFeedback	13	3	You're warm, but you need an additional electron-flow arrow to show how the new C=O &#960; bond forms. Whence does that pair of electrons come?
evalFeedback	13	5	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons. There is a way to draw the electron-flow arrows that uses fewer of them.

Topic: More about multistep synthesis; Set: 1-Allylcyclohexanol
header			Two starting materials can be combined to give this compound in a single step by formation of the dashed bond.  One contains a six-membered ring; the other does not.  
qStmt	1		Draw the starting material that contains the six-membered ring.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  When a nucleophile attacks the carbonyl C, an alcohol is obtained.
evalFeedback	1	2	You want to make a bond to the C attached to the O. Secondary alcohols undergo substitutions at this C, but this reaction removes the OH group, and you want an OH group in your product.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral starting material.
evalFeedback	1	4	How many C atoms should the answer have?
evalFeedback	1	5	Alpha-hydroxycarbanions are not unheard of, but they are difficult to prepare and handle. There is a much better answer.
evalFeedback	1	6	The starting material should have all of the C-C, C-H, and C-O bonds of the appropriate section of the target.
evalFeedback	1	7	Alpha-haloalcohols such as the one you drew are not stable.  The elements of HX are lost to give what electrophile?
evalFeedback	1	8	Your answer doesn't have the appropriate functionality at the C that needs to form the bond.
qStmt	2		Draw the starting material that does not contain the six-membered ring.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  To make the three-carbon group a nucleophile, a metal should be attached to this fragment.
evalFeedback	2	2	This is the synthetic equivalent you need, but it's not a stable starting material. What element should be attached to the anionic C to make it retain its nucleophilic properties?
evalFeedback	2	3	How many carbon atoms must this fragment contain?
evalFeedback	2	4	The double bond in the target should be present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	2	5	There are good synthetic equivalents for allyl cations, but it would require that the other starting material be a carbanion, and there aren't good synthetic equivalents for #a-hydroxycarbanions.
evalFeedback	2	6	An allylic halide would require that the other starting material be a carbanion, and there aren't good synthetic equivalents for #a-hydroxycarbanions.
evalFeedback	2	7	Your answer does not have the appropriate functionality on the C that needs to make the bond.
qStmt	3		Draw the starting material that contains the six-membered ring.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  When the #b-&gamma; bond of an alcohol is disconnected, the best starting material is an epoxide, where the alcohol O now has a bond to the #b-carbon.
evalFeedback	3	2	This is the synthetic equivalent you need, but it's not a stable starting material. What stable starting material is electrophilic at the required position?
evalFeedback	3	3	This answer is pretty good.  You have made the key C atom electrophilic by making it an alkyl halide.  However, there's an even better answer.  What other functional group is electrophilic with a single leaving group attached to the electrophilic C?  Hint: It contains O, and even though the O leaves the electrophilic C, it stays in the molecule.
evalFeedback	3	4	Your answer should contain the same number of C atoms as the fragment of the molecule on the ring-containing side of the dashed bond.
evalFeedback	3	5	The starting material you draw should contain all the C-H, C-C, and C-O bonds in the cyclohexane-containing fragment of the target.
evalFeedback	3	6	A carbanion or organometallic compound like the one you have drawn would be very unstable because it would be protonated by the OH group or would eject HO^-. (Protection of the OH group would solve the first problem but not the second one.)
evalFeedback	3	7	Your answer doesn't have appropriate functionality at the C that needs to form the bond.
qStmt	4		Draw the starting material that does not contain the six-membered ring.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  A vinylmetal species will be the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	4	2	This is the synthetic equivalent you need, but it is not a stable starting material. What kind of compound acts as a C nucleophile?
evalFeedback	4	3	There are not very many good synthetic equivalents for alkenyl cations. Try another type of disconnection.
evalFeedback	4	4	Count your carbon atoms carefully!
evalFeedback	4	5	The double bond in the target should be present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	4	6	Alkenyl halides are not good electrophiles.  Try a different approach.
evalFeedback	4	7	Your answer doesn't have appropriate functionality at the C that needs to form the bond.
Topic: More about multistep synthesis; Set: Intramolecular reactions
header			Draw the starting material that can be used to make the following compound by an intramolecular C-C bond-forming reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  An intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction gives the observed product.
evalFeedback	1	2	The reaction that produces the given compound is intramolecular, so there is a single starting material.
evalFeedback	1	3	Not an unreasonable answer! However, the starting material is likely to be very difficult to prepare. Try something else.
evalFeedback	1	4	In this intramolecular reaction, the starting material and product must have the same number of C atoms.
evalFeedback	1	5	You are being asked to disconnect one or more C-C bonds, so the correct answer must have fewer C-C bonds than the compound above.
evalFeedback	1	6	The best answer to this problem gives the product by a process that forms <b>two</b> new C-C bonds.  What reaction have you learned that forms two C-C bonds simultaneously?  What bonds do you disconnect in the product to get to the starting material?
evalFeedback	1	7	The correct answer should not have any C-C bonds that are not present in the product.
evalFeedback	1	8	The starting material should have the same number of H atoms as the product.
evalFeedback	1	9	The double bond in the product should be the middle two C atoms of the diene in the starting material.  The bond across from the double bond in the product should be the alkene in the product.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  An intramolecular aldol reaction gives the product shown.
evalFeedback	2	2	The reaction that produces the given compound is intramolecular, so there is a single starting material.
evalFeedback	2	3	In an intramolecular reaction, the starting material and the product must have the same number of C atoms.
evalFeedback	2	4	You are being asked to disconnect one or more C-C bonds, so the correct answer must have fewer C-C bonds than the compound above.
evalFeedback	2	5	An intramolecular reaction is usually a ring-forming reaction.  How many rings should the starting material have?
evalFeedback	2	6	The best disconnection is between the #a- and #b-carbons of the ketone.  The #a,#b-bond of a carbonyl compound can be made by a host of acid- or base-catalyzed reactions between the #a-carbon of the carbonyl and a C electrophile.
evalFeedback	2	7	The C=C #pi bond is best formed in the intramolecular reaction.  The starting material shouldn't contain it.
evalFeedback	2	8	The C atom that becomes the #b-carbon in the product must be electrophilic in the starting material so it can react with the nucleophilic #a-carbon of the ketone.
evalFeedback	2	9	You have correctly made the terminal C of the starting material electrophilic, the product of an intramolecular reaction of this compound will lack the C=C bond.  What other functional group would make that terminal C electrophilic?
evalFeedback	2	10	Your answer doesn't have the correct functional group on the terminal C atom.  What other functional group would make that terminal C electrophilic and would give rise to a C=C #pi bond in the product?
evalFeedback	3	1	Excellent!  An intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction gives the observed product.
evalFeedback	3	2	The reaction that produces the given compound is intramolecular, so there is a single starting material.
evalFeedback	3	3	In this intramolecular reaction, the starting material and the product must have the same number of C atoms.
evalFeedback	3	4	Starting materials containing aromatic rings are very easy to obtain, so your answer is likely to have the aromatic ring already assembled.
evalFeedback	3	5	This is an intermediate in the correct reaction, but it's not a stable starting material. What starting material is used to generate this intermediate?
evalFeedback	3	6	You are being asked to disconnect one or more C-C bonds, so the correct answer must have fewer C-C bonds than the compound above.
evalFeedback	3	7	Your disconnection is not entirely unreasonable, but there's a better one.  Hint: The functional group is involved.
evalFeedback	3	8	You've made the best disconnection, but you could draw a better starting material. What reaction is best for making an aryl-ketone bond?  What does the starting material for this reaction look like?
evalFeedback	3	9	You haven't made the best disconnection.  What bond in this compound would be easiest to make?  (Hint: The functional group is involved.)

header			Undergraduate research assistant Bartholomew Humdinger is planning to carry out the reaction shown. Unfortunately, it does not work as planned. Draw the product that Bartholomew actually obtains.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  The Grignard reagent will attack the ketone before it attacks the ester.  The ester may subsequently be attacked by the Grignard reagent or by the alkoxide, or it may remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	1	2	Assume a mildly acidic workup.  The product should be neutral and should not contain any Mg.
evalFeedback	1	3	Br is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Enols tautomerize very rapidly to the corresponding carbonyl compounds.
evalFeedback	1	5	All of the C-H and C-C bonds of the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	1	6	Ketones are almost never obtained from reactions of Grignard reagents with esters.
evalFeedback	1	7	What happens when a ketone encounters a Grignard reagent?
evalFeedback	1	8	The Grignard reagent is CH3CH2MgBr, not CH3MgBr.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The free OH group attacks the acyl chloride faster than the aromatic ring does, so an ester is obtained.
evalFeedback	2	2	No, the problem is not with the regiochemistry of the Friedel-Crafts reaction.
evalFeedback	2	3	No, the product does not contain S.
evalFeedback	2	4	All the C-C bonds, the two CH2 groups, and the carbonyl group of the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	2	5	What does SOCl2 do to a carboxylic acid?
evalFeedback	2	6	What in the starting material could react with the acyl chloride?
evalFeedback	2	7	Step 1 converts the acid into an acyl chloride.  What could react with this acyl chloride?
evalFeedback	2	8	No, the product does not contain Cl.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  N is much more nucleophilic than O, so the Ts group goes on N in step 1.  Step 2 has no effect because neither NHTs nor  OH is a good leaving group.
evalFeedback	3	2	Why would tosylation of N affect the configuration of the stereogenic C atom?
evalFeedback	3	3	Please indicate the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	5	Na is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	The Cl in TsCl is a leaving group. It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	7	NaCN is a very good nucleophile, so if any reaction takes place, it will be substitution, not elimination.
evalFeedback	3	8	All of the C-C and C-H bonds of the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	3	9	Neither NH2 nor NHTs is a good leaving group.
evalFeedback	3	10	With which group in the starting material is TsCl most likely to react?
evalFeedback	3	11	To which atom will the Ts group attach in step 1?
evalFeedback	3	12	Only one equivalent of TsCl is used, it reacts with N, and the OH group is not a good leaving group, so why would your answer not contain an OH group?
evalFeedback	3	13	Cyanide is nucleophilic, and so is N, even when it is attached to Ts, so an N-C#tripleN bond will not be obtained.

header			Draw the major product of the following reaction after aqueous workup.  
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  Primary alcohols are oxidized to carboxylic acids under these conditions.

evalFeedback	1	10	An alcohol is converted to what new functional group when it is treated with these reagents?
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  Acyl chlorides are reduced only to aldehydes under these conditions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Reduction all the way to the alcohol takes place only if a Pd catalyst that has not been deactivated is used.
evalFeedback	2	3	Pd is a catalyst in this reaction. It is not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  Steps 1 and 2 add H2O across the triple bond in anti-Markovnikov fashion to give an aldehyde.  Step 3 reduces the aldehyde to an alcohol.
evalFeedback	3	2	What is the regiochemistry of hydroboration?
evalFeedback	3	3	This compound is the immediate product of step 2, but it is an enol, so it tautomerizes to a different compound before step 3 is executed.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	3	6	No metals are incorporated into the organic product.  Any metal present in an intermediate would be replaced with H upon workup.

evalFeedback	3	12	What functional group does hydroboration-oxidation of a terminal alkyne introduce?  What happens when this compound is treated with LiAlH4?
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  Amides are reduced to amines by LiAlH4.
evalFeedback	4	2	The reduction of esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, and aldehydes with LiAlH4 gives alcohols, but the reduction of amides gives a different product.
evalFeedback	4	3	Aldehydes are extremely reactive toward LiAlH4, so cannot possibly be a product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Hemiaminals such as this one are exceedingly unstable.  They convert to imines under these reaction conditions.
evalFeedback	4	5	Imines can be reduced further by LiAlH4.
evalFeedback	4	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	8	LiAlH4 is a reducing agent.  Its metals are not incorporated into the organic product.

evalFeedback	5	5	What element that a peracid has in abundance should your answer have?

evalFeedback	5	7	What functional group is obtained when a peracid reacts with an alkene?
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The triple bond is reduced to the trans double bond.
evalFeedback	6	2	This reaction is thermodynamically controlled, meaning that the more stable alkene isomer is obtained.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please indicate the configuration of the double bond.
evalFeedback	6	4	An alkyne is not reduced all the way to an alkane under these conditions.
evalFeedback	6	5	The compound you drew is indeed an intermediate, but it is further reduced by Na to give a closed-shell compound (one in which every atom has its octet).
evalFeedback	6	6	The compound you drew is indeed an intermediate, but it is further protonated by NH3 to give a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	6	7	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	6	12	Na is a source of electrons, and NH3 is a source of protons.  What reaction would an alkyne undergo under these conditions?
evalFeedback	6	13	The alkene C=C bond should be in the same position as the C#tripleC bond was in the starting material.
evalFeedback	6	14	What functional group is obtained from the reaction of an alkyne with Na and NH3?

evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  Step 1 epoxidizes the ring, and step 2 opens the ring nucleophilically with the nucleophile CH3^- , giving the trans product.
evalFeedback	8	2	When Grignard reagents react with epoxides, the stereochemistry at the reacting epoxide C is inverted, whereas the sterochemistry at the other epoxide C remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please specify the relative configuration of the two stereocenters.
evalFeedback	8	4	What is the reactivity of the C atom in CH3MgBr?  Which atom in the functional group obtained after step 1 has complementary reactivity?
evalFeedback	8	5	Any MgBr that may be present after step 2 is replaced with H upon workup, so the product contains no Mg or Br.
evalFeedback	8	6	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	8	12	A peracid delivers only one O atom to an alkene.

evalFeedback	8	14	What is the functional group after step 1?  This functional group reacts with a Grignard reagent to give what new functional group?
evalFeedback	8	15	When a Grignard reagent reacts with an epoxide, the newly introduced alkyl group should end up attached to the C adjacent to the one that bears the new OH group.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  This reagent promotes syn-dihydroxylation of alkenes.  The same reaction could be accomplished with OsO4 followed by an aq. NaHSO3 workup.
evalFeedback	9	2	The two C-O bonds are formed simultaneously. What does this tell you about their stereochemistry?

header			Draw the major product of the following reaction after aqueous workup.  
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  When an alkene is warmed with basic aq. KMnO4, it undegoes oxidative cleavage, and any aldehyde that is obtained is further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.  The by-product of this reaction, CO2, is lost upon workup.
evalFeedback	1	2	This product is formed when an alkene is reacted with KMnO4 at room temperature or below.  Since the reaction is taking place at a higher temperature, the diol formed will be further oxidized.

evalFeedback	5	7	None of the <i>single</i> bonds in the starting material are affected by this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	8	What happens to alkenes under these conditions?

evalFeedback	4	7	Please label all the H atoms.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  Every H is ortho to one Cl and meta to the other, so all four are equivalent.
evalFeedback	5	2	Why would two H atoms that are both meta to one Cl and ortho to the other not have the same chemical shift?  Look for the two planes of symmetry bisecting the ring.  Together, they relate all four H atoms to one another.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  Two H atoms are ortho to Cl and meta to Br, and the other two, vice versa.
evalFeedback	6	2	Why would an H atom ortho to Cl have to have the same chemical shift as one ortho to Br?
evalFeedback	6	3	Why would the two H atoms ortho to Cl have different chemical shifts?  Both are also meta to Br.  Look for the plane of symmetry bisecting the ring, containing the C-Cl and C-Br bonds, and relating two pairs of H atoms.

evalFeedback	8	2	Why would an H atom ortho to two Br atoms have to have the same chemical shift as one that is ortho to only one?
evalFeedback	8	3	Why would an H atom ortho to two Br atoms have to have the same chemical shift as one that is ortho to none?

evalFeedback	8	6	Please label all of the H atoms.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  There is no plane or axis of symmetry in this compound, so the only H atoms that are equivalent are each set of three H atoms in the CH3 groups.
evalFeedback	9	2	Would you expect a methine H atom to have to have the same chemical shift as an H atom that is not a methine?
evalFeedback	9	3	Would you expect the H atoms of a CH3 group and the H atoms of a CH2 group to have to have the same chemical shift?
evalFeedback	9	4	Would you expect two H atoms of a CH3 group to have different chemical shifts?

evalFeedback	9	7	Please label all of the H atoms.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!
evalFeedback	10	2	Why would an H atom adjacent to the C=O group be equivalent to one not adjacent to the C=O group?
evalFeedback	10	3	Why would an H atom in a CH3 group be equivalent to one in a CH2 group?

evalFeedback	10	7	Does this compound have symmetry that relates the left and right halves?
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!
evalFeedback	11	2	Does this compound have symmetry that relates the left and right halves?
evalFeedback	11	3	The two H atoms of each CH2 group in this compound are diastereotopic.  Within each CH2 group, one H is cis to the ketone, and one is trans.

evalFeedback	11	5	Is the methine H equivalent to either of the H atoms of the CH2 groups?

evalFeedback	15	5	What element of symmetry does this compound have, and how does it relate some of the H atoms of the CH2CH2 group?
evalFeedback	15	6	What element of symmetry does this compound have, and how does it relate (or not relate) some of the H atoms of the CH2CH2 group?
evalFeedback	15	7	Either you have failed to label all the H atoms, or you have incorrectly labelled some H atoms with the same number.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  There's a plane of symmetry in the plane of the screen.  The three H atoms of the alkene are different from one another because one is cis to the propyl group, one is trans, and one is geminal.
evalFeedback	16	2	Is there any symmetry in this compound that relates the forward- and backward-pointing H atoms?
evalFeedback	16	3	Would any of the three H atoms of the CH3 group be different from one another?
evalFeedback	16	4	Look at the H atoms on the terminal C(sp2) atom.  Are they in identical chemical environments?
evalFeedback	16	5	Is the H atom on the internal C(sp2) in the same chemical environment as either of the H atoms on the terminal C(sp2)?
evalFeedback	16	6	Either you have failed to label all the H atoms, or you have incorrectly labelled some H atoms with the same number.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!  There is no plane of symmetry in this compound, so the two H atoms of the CH2 group are inequivalent, but the three H atoms of each CH3 group exchange their environments by rotation about #sigma bonds, as do the two ortho H atoms and the two meta H atoms on the Ph ring.
evalFeedback	17	2	Close, but not quite. There is no plane of symmetry in this compound. What does that tell you about the equivalency of the two H atoms of the CH2 group on the right side of the structure?
evalFeedback	17	3	How many different kinds of H atoms are on the Ph ring?
evalFeedback	17	4	The two ortho H atoms of the Ph ring and the two meta H atoms can exchange their environments by rotation about the Ph-C bond.
evalFeedback	17	5	The three H atoms of each CH3 group exchange their environments by rotation about #sigma bonds.
evalFeedback	17	6	The three H atoms of each CH3 group exchange their environments by rotation about #sigma bonds.

evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  Numbering from left to right, the H atoms of C(1) and C(3) have two neighbors distinct from themselves, so they are a triplet; the H atoms of C(2) have two neighbors of one kind and three neighbors of another kind distinct from themselves, so they are a triplet or quartets; and the H atoms of C(4) have no neighbors distinct from themselves, so they are a singlet.
evalFeedback	1	2	In this compound, the two or three H atoms attached to each C are all identical, so they should have the same multiplicity.
evalFeedback	1	3	The multiplicity of an H atom is given by the number of <i>unlike neighboring</i> H atoms, not the number of like H atoms.
evalFeedback	1	4	Each H atom on the rightmost C atom has no neighbors unlike itself attached to the same C atom or an adjacent C atom.  What should be the multiplicities of the H atoms on the rightmost C atom?
evalFeedback	1	5	An H atom with <i>n</i> identical neighbors unlike itself will have a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	1	6	Each H atom on the leftmost C atom has two neighbors unlike itself attached to the same C atom or an adjacent C atom.  What should be the multiplicities of the H atoms on the leftmost C atom?
evalFeedback	1	7	Each H atom on the C atom to the left of the O atom has two neighbors unlike itself attached to the same C atom or an adjacent C atom.  What should be the multiplicities of the H atoms on the C atom left of the O atom?
evalFeedback	1	8	You're right that the H atoms on the second C atom from the left have five neighbors different from themselves.  But these neighbors are divided into one set of two and one set of three, and the coupling constants to the set of two would not necessarily be the same as the coupling constants to the set of three.  Treat the two sets as independent actors when deciding the multiplicities of the H atoms on the second C atom from the left.
evalFeedback	1	9	The H atoms on the second C atom from the left have two neighbor H atoms unlike themselves to the right, and three neighbor H atoms unlike themselves to the left.  What should be the multiplicities of the H atoms on the second C atom from the left?
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  The ortho, meta, and para H atoms are, respectively, a doublet, a doublet of doublets, and a triplet.  (This analysis ignores long-range coupling.)
evalFeedback	2	2	The two ortho H atoms should have the same multiplicity, as should the two meta H atoms.
evalFeedback	2	3	An H atom with <i>n</i> identical neighboring H atoms unlike itself has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	2	4	Each ortho H atom has one neighbor not like itself.  What should be its multiplicity?
evalFeedback	2	5	The para H atom has two neighbors identical to each other but different from the para H atom.  What should be the multiplicity of the para H atom?
evalFeedback	2	6	Yes, each meta H atom has two neighbors, but the ortho H atom is different from the para H atom, so the meta H atom will not be a triplet.
evalFeedback	2	7	Each meta H atom neighbors one ortho H atom and one para H atom.  What should be the multiplicity of the meta H atom?
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  The two H atoms of the CH2Cl group are diastereotopic, so each one comprises its own independent set.  As a result, each one is a dd, and the methine H atom is a ddq.
evalFeedback	3	2	The three H atoms of each CH3 group are always identical.
evalFeedback	3	3	The multiplicity of an H atom is determined by the number of <i>unlike neighboring</i> H atoms, not the number of H atoms identical to it.
evalFeedback	3	4	An H atom with <i>n</i> neighbors unlike itself has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	3	5	The three H atoms of the CH3 group have one neighbor unlike themselves.  What should be their multiplicity?
evalFeedback	3	6	The two H atoms of the CH2Cl group are diastereotopic, so each one comprises its own independent set.  As a result, each H atom of the CH2Cl group has <i>two</i> sets of neighbors unlike itself.  One set consists of the one other H atom on the same C, and the other set consists of the one methine H atom.
evalFeedback	3	7	You're right that the methine H atom has five neighbors, but these neighbors are not all alike.  Each set of identical neighbors should be counted independently toward the multiplicity.
evalFeedback	3	8	The two H atoms of the CH2Cl group are diastereotopic, so each one comprises its own independent set.  As a result, the methine H atom has <i>three</i> sets of neighbors, comprising one, one, and three H atoms, respectively.
evalFeedback	3	9	How many neighbors different from itself does the methine H atom have?
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  The F atom is magnetically active with a spin of &plusmn;&frac12;, so it splits nearby H atoms (attached to the same C atom or an adjacent one) into doublets.  The H atoms of the CH3 group are also split into a triplet by the neighboring methylene H atoms, and the H atoms of the CH2 group are also split into a quartet by the neighboring methyl H atoms.
evalFeedback	4	2	Not quite.  What do you know about the behavior of F atoms in the ^1H NMR spectra of organic compounds?
evalFeedback	4	3	The H-F coupling constants may be different from the H-H coupling constant, so you need to treat the F atom as a separate set from the CH2 and CH3 groups when determining multiplicities.
evalFeedback	4	4	Almost, but not quite there.  The F atom engages in both two- and three-bond coupling interactions.
evalFeedback	4	5	The three H atoms of the CH3 group have the same multiplicity, as do the two H atoms of the CH2 group, and the two groups have different multiplicities.
evalFeedback	4	6	Don't label the F atom.  It does not produce a resonance in the ^1H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	4	7	The multiplicities of the H atoms of the CH2 group are correct, but not those of the CH3 group.  How many magnetically active neighbors different from themselves do the H atoms of the CH3 group have?  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors leads to a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	4	8	The multiplicities of the H atoms of the CH3 group are correct, but not those of the CH2 group.  How many magnetically active neighbors different from themselves do the H atoms of the CH2 group have?  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors leads to a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	4	9	How many magnetically active neighbors different from themselves do the H atoms of the CH3 group have?  What about the H atoms of the CH2 group?  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors leads to a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  The H atoms of the OH group does not couple due to rapid exchange.  The two CH3 groups are equivalent, making the methine H a septet.
evalFeedback	5	2	Don't forget to label the H atom attached to O.
evalFeedback	5	3	There are three distinct sets of H atoms in this compound: the H atom of the OH group, the methine H, and the CH3 atoms.
evalFeedback	5	4	Consider the H atoms of the CH3 groups.  The multiplicity of each is determined by the number of H atoms distinct from itself attached to the same C atom or an adjacent C atom.  Each set of <i>n</i> such H atoms gives rise to a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	5	5	The H atom of the OH group does not couple to neighboring H atoms due to rapid exchange.
evalFeedback	5	6	How many neighbors attached to the same C atom or an adjacent C atom distinct from itself does the methine H atom have?  Each set of <i>n</i> such neighbors gives rise to a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  All H atoms are doublets, having one neighbor different from themselves.  (This analysis ignores long-range coupling.)
evalFeedback	6	2	The two H atoms ortho to the Cl atoms are related by symmetry, so they should have the same multiplicity.
evalFeedback	6	3	The two H atoms not ortho to any Cl atoms are related by symmetry, so they should have the same multiplicity.
evalFeedback	6	4	Each H atom ortho to a Cl atom has one neighboring H atom not identical to itself.  What should be the multiplicity of the H atoms ortho to Cl atoms?
evalFeedback	6	5	Each H atom not ortho to a Cl atom has one neighboring H atom different from itself.  What should be the multiplicity of the H atoms not ortho to any Cl atoms?
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  Each H atom ortho to a heteroatom has one neighbor different from itself, making it a doublet.  Each of the other two H atoms has two neighbors different from itself, one of one kind and one of another, so they are doublets of doublets.  (This analysis ignores long-range coupling.)
evalFeedback	7	2	Each H atom ortho to a heteroatom has one neighboring H atom not identical to itself.  What should be the multiplicity of the H atoms ortho to heteroatoms?
evalFeedback	7	3	You're right that each H atom not ortho to a heteroatom has two neighboring H atoms different from itself.  However, these two H atoms are different from one another, so they need to be treated as separate sets.  As a result, each H atom not ortho to a heteroatom is neighbored by one set of one H atom and another set of one H atom.  What would be its multiplicity?
evalFeedback	7	4	Each H atom not ortho to a heteroatom has two neighboring H atoms different from itself (and from each other).  What should be the multiplicity of the H atoms not ortho to any heteroatoms?
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  The H atom ortho to both Cl atoms has no near neighbors, so it is a singlet.  Each H atom ortho to one Cl atom has one near neighbor, so it is a doublet.  The H atom meta to both Cl atoms has two near neighbors identical to each other, so it is a triplet.
evalFeedback	8	2	The two H atoms ortho to one Cl atom and para to the other are related by symmetry, so they should have the same multiplicity.
evalFeedback	8	3	The H atom ortho to both Cl atoms has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	8	4	Each H atom ortho to one Cl atom and para to the other has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	8	5	The H atom meta to both Cl atoms has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  All H atoms are related by symmetry, so none has a neighbor different from itself, so all are singlets.
evalFeedback	9	2	Every H atom is ortho to Cl atom and meta to the other.  What does that tell you about the multiplicities of the H atoms in this compound?
evalFeedback	9	3	Each H atom has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  Every H atom has one near neighbor different from itself, so each is a doublet.  (This analysis ignores long-range coupling.)
evalFeedback	10	2	The two H atoms ortho to Cl are related by symmetry, so they must have the same multiplicity, as must the two H atoms ortho to Br.
evalFeedback	10	3	Each H atom has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  The four H atoms on C(2) and C(4) are identical to one another, so they do not couple to one another; the same is true of the two H atoms on C(3).  However, when each H atom on C(2) (or C(4)) looks over to C(3), it sees two distinct H atom, one cis and one trans to itself, so it becomes a doublet of doublets.  Each H atom on C(3) sees two identical H atoms cis to itself and two identical H atoms trans to itself, so it becomes a triplet of triplets.
evalFeedback	11	2	A plane of symmetry in the plane of the screen relates the H atoms coming towards you with those going away from you, and another plane of symmetry horizontal and perpendicular to the plane of the screen relates the H atoms on C(2) to those on C(4).  Identical H atoms should have identical multiplicities.
evalFeedback	11	3	Yes, each C(2) and C(4) H atom has two neighbors different from itself, but they are not triplets.  Consider yourself as one of the C(2) H atoms.  You look over at C(3) and see two H atoms.  From your perspective, do these two H atoms look identical?  So what should be the multiplicity of the H atoms on C(2)?
evalFeedback	11	4	Yes, each C(3) H atom has four neighbors different from itself, but it is not a quintet.  Consider yourself as one of the C(3) H atoms.  You look over at C(2).  Do the two H atoms on C(2) look identical from your perspective?  Now look over at C(4).  Do those two H atoms look identical to you?  How many of the H atoms on C(2) look identical to the H atoms on C(4)?  So what should be the multiplicity of each H atom on C(3)?
evalFeedback	11	5	There is a better answer for the multiplicity of the C(3) H atoms.  The two C(3) H atoms will not couple with one another because they are identical.  Also, there is symmetry relating the H atoms on C(2) to those on C(4), so the C(3) H atoms do not have too many sets of neighboring H atoms.
evalFeedback	11	6	Each C(2) and C(4) H atom has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	11	7	Each C(3) H atom has how many near neighbors different from itself?  An H atom with <i>n</i> such neighbors has a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  The H atom attached to N does not couple to the other H atoms.  The two H atoms on the terminal C(sp2) are different because one is cis to the rest of the compound, and the other is trans.  This analysis excludes long-range coupling, for example between the allylic H atom and the terminal C(sp2) H atoms, which is quite commonly observed.
evalFeedback	12	2	The three H atoms of each CH3 group are identical, so they must have the same multiplicity.
evalFeedback	12	3	Consider the H atoms of the lower-left CH3 group.  How many neighbors different from themselves are attached to the same C or an adjacent C?  If there are <i>n</i> such neighbors, the multiplicity is <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	4	H atoms attached to heteroatoms generally do not couple to other H atoms because of rapid exchange.
evalFeedback	12	5	Consider the H atoms of the NCH3 group.  How many neighbors different from themselves are attached to the same C or an adjacent C?  If there are <i>n</i> such neighbors, the multiplicity is <i>n + 1</i>.  Remember, H atoms generally do not couple to H atoms attached to heteroatoms.
evalFeedback	12	6	You're right that the methine H atom has one kind of neighbor to the right, splitting it into a doublet, and three of another kind of neighbor to the left splitting it into a quartet.  However, H atoms generally do not couple to H atoms attached to heteroatoms, so the H atom of the NH group will not split it further.
evalFeedback	12	7	You're right that the methine H atom has five neighbors.  However, the neighbor to the right is different from the three to the left, so they need to be treated as different sets.  Each set of <i>n</i> such neighbors will produce a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.  The neighbor to the north is attached to a heteroatom, so it doesn't couple at all.
evalFeedback	12	8	How many sets of neighbors different from itself does the methine H atom have?  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors will create a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	9	You're right that the internal C(sp2)-H atom has three neighbors.  However, the neighbor to the right is attached to C(sp3), and of those to the right, one is cis and the other is trans.  Therefore, each neighbor acts as an independent set of one.  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors creates a separate multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	10	You're right that the internal C(sp2)-H atom has three neighbors, and that the neighbor on the left is different from those on the right.  However, of those to the right, one is cis and the other is trans to the internal C(sp2)-H atom.  Therefore, each neighbor acts as an independent set of one.  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors creates a separate multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	11	How many sets of neighbors different from itself does the internal C(sp2)-H atom have?  Each set of <i>n</i> neighbors will create a multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	12	Each terminal C(sp2)-H atom is indeed coupled to the internal C(sp2)-H atom.  However, the terminal C(sp2)-H atoms are also coupled to one another, because they are different from one another.  One is cis to the rest of the compound, and the other is trans.
evalFeedback	12	13	The terminal C(sp2)-H atoms are coupled to one another, because they are different from one another: one is cis to the rest of the compound, and the other is trans.  Each terminal C(sp2)-H atom is also coupled to the internal C(sp2)-H atom.  Each set of <i>n</i> H atoms creates its own multiplicity of <i>n + 1</i>.
evalFeedback	12	14	Please label all H atoms.
Topic: NMR spectroscopy; Set: Extracting coupling constants
qStmt	1		Consider the multiplet shown, which was obtained on a 400 MHz spectrometer. How many individual coupling constants can you extract from it? Treat every coupling constant as distinct; for example, a triplet has two coupling constants (which just happen to be identical).
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! Adding the relative heights of the peaks gives 16, which is 2<sup>4</sup>.
evalFeedback	1	2	You can't just count the number of peaks, because some peaks are superimposed on others. How can you tell how many superimposed peaks contribute to each visible peak?
evalFeedback	1	3	A resonance with <i>n</i> coupling constants will be split into 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> peaks, some or many of which will be superimposed upon one another. What data does the spectrum provide that allows you to count the total number of peaks, including ones that are superimposed?

evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  A benzene ring uses up four degrees of unsaturation.  The downfield quartet is due to the benzylic CH, and the upfield doublet is due to the CH3 group.
evalFeedback	2	2	That's not C8H9Br.
evalFeedback	2	3	This compound would show two triplets in the nonaromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not a doublet and a quartet.

evalFeedback	3	3	A downfield quartet and an upfield triplet usually indicates the presence of an isolated ethyl group.  (Note the presence of two such pairs in the spectrum.)
evalFeedback	3	4	This compound has an isolated CH3 group, so its ^1H NMR spectrum would have a singlet.
evalFeedback	3	5	The C(sp2)&ndash;H in this compound would give rise to a singlet very far downfield, about 8.5 ppm.
evalFeedback	3	6	An alkene is unlikely.  Unless it is tetrasubstituted, an alkene will show C(sp2)-H absorbances downfield of 4.5 ppm.

evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  Only this isomer has a downfield doublet (due to the CHCl carbon) in the spin-coupled 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	5	2	Compound <b>B</b> must have the formula C4H9Cl.
evalFeedback	5	3	This compound would give rise to three 13C NMR resonances.
evalFeedback	5	4	There are no CH groups in this molecule, so a doublet would not be observed in the spin-coupled 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	5	5	This compound would give rise to two 13C NMR resonances.

evalFeedback	1	7	A singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H is usually indicative of an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
evalFeedback	1	8	You're on the right track, but your structure would give a singlet, a quartet, and a triplet. How can you rearrange the structure to separate the CH2 and CH3 groups from one another?
evalFeedback	1	9	The ^1H NMR spectrum of your response would not have three singlets in 9:3:2 ratio.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  The iPr group gives rise to the doublet of 6 H upfield and the septet downfield, and the Pr group gives rise to the two triplets and the sextet.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your response doesn't have the formula C7H14O.

evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw an alkoxide <i>and</i> and alkyl bromide (two molecules).
evalFeedback	4	3	You've identified the product correctly, but not the starting materials.  The major product of these two reactants would be an elimination product, not the product whose NMR spectrum is shown.  What other disconnection of the target could you make?

qStmt	5		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with formula C11H16 is shown here. Identify the compound.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct! The degrees of unsaturation and signals at ~7.2 indicate that the compound contains a benzene ring.  The two singlets with integral ratios of ~1:4.5 suggests the structure of the other hydrocarbon fragment in the molecule.
evalFeedback	5	2	That's not C11H16.
evalFeedback	5	3	What do the number of degrees of unsaturation and the resonances at ~7.2 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	5	4	What does the integration of the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum signify about the benzene ring's substitution pattern?
evalFeedback	5	5	The aromatic ring takes C6H5, so you have five C atoms and eleven H atoms to arrange in the side chain.  The C(sp3)-H region of the NMR spectrum shows a 2 H singlet and a 9 H singlet to make eleven H atoms.  What structure would give rise to such a spectrum?
qStmt	6		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound of formula C11H16 is shown here. Identify the compound.
evalFeedback	6	1	Correct! The 2 H doublets at ~7.1 and ~7.3 ppm indicate that the compound contains a benzene ring with 1,4-disubstitution.  The upfield 3 H and 9 H singlets suggest the structures of the other hydrocarbon fragments in the molecule.
evalFeedback	6	2	That's not C11H16.
evalFeedback	6	3	What do the resonances at ~7.1-7.3 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	6	4	What do the two 2 H doublets at ~7.1 and 7.3 ppm signify about the substitution pattern of the benzene ring?

qStmt	7		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C8H8 is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	7	1	Correct! The resonances at ~7.1-7.4 ppm integrating to 5 H indicate that the compound contains a monosubstituted benzene ring. The three 1 H multiplets at 5-7 ppm represent the three alkenyl H atoms.  (The geminal coupling between the two terminal H atoms is too small to observe.)
evalFeedback	7	2	That's not C8H8.
evalFeedback	7	3	What do the resonances at ~7.1-7.4 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	7	4	What do the three 1 H resonances at 5-7 ppm signify?
qStmt	8		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C6H12O is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	8	1	Correct! Only this isomer would show two singlets in 1:3 ratio.
evalFeedback	8	2	That's not C6H12O.
evalFeedback	8	3	An alkene would either have a C(sp2)&ndash;H group, which the NMR spectrum rules out, or would have to be tetrasubstituted, which is unlikely given the small size of this compound and the presence of two singlets in the NMR spectrum.  How else can the one degree of unsaturation be used?
evalFeedback	8	4	It's unlikely that a cyclic compound of C6H12O could give an NMR spectrum with two singlets in 3:9 ratio.  How else can the one degree of unsaturation be used?
evalFeedback	8	5	An aldehyde would show a resonance very far downfield (9-11 ppm).
evalFeedback	8	6	A singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H is usually indicative of an acetyl group (CH3C=O).

evalFeedback	9	4	An aldehyde would give rise to a resonance very far downfield.  How else can you use the one degree of unsaturation?
evalFeedback	9	5	A cyclic structure could not give rise to a single singlet.  How else can you use the one degree of unsaturation?
evalFeedback	9	6	What hydrocarbon fragment gives rise to a single singlet and has <i>n</i> H atoms, where <i>n</i> is a factor of 18?  This compound must have all of its H atoms in one or more of such fragments.
qStmt	10		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C4H8O is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	10	1	Correct! The vinyl group gives rise to the two doublets (geminal coupling is too small to be observed as doublet of doublets) and the doublet of doublets in 1:1:1 ratio.  Two of the resonances are particularly far upfield because of the electron-donating ability (resonance) of the O atom.   The ethyl group gives rise to a downfield 2 H quartet and an upfield 3 H triplet.
evalFeedback	10	2	That's not C4H8O.
evalFeedback	10	3	What hydrocarbon fragment do the downfield 2 H quartet and the upfield 3 H triplet signify?
evalFeedback	10	4	What do the two doublets and the doublet of doublets with the integral ratio of 1:1:1 in the region of ~4.0-6.5 ppm indicate about the structure of the hydrocarbon fragment present in the compound?
qStmt	11		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C6H12O2 is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	11	1	Correct! A singlet at ~2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H indicates an acetyl group.  The downfield 2 H triplet, the middle 2 H multiplets, and the upfield 3 H triplet indicate a butoxy group.
evalFeedback	11	2	That's not C6H12O2.
evalFeedback	11	3	You're very close, but the CH3 group in this compound would resonate considerably further downfield than it does in the unknown, and the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would resonate considerably further upfield than it does in the unknown.  How else can you arrange the hydrocarbon fragments around the ester?
evalFeedback	11	4	Note the resonance about 4 ppm.  What functional group in a compound containing only C, H, two O, and one degree of unsaturation would give rise to a resonance with such a chemical shift?
evalFeedback	11	5	A singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H is usually indicative of an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
evalFeedback	11	6	The acetyl group uses C2H3O, leaving C4H9O left to assign.  The signal farthest downfield in the spectrum is a triplet, indicating that the C atom is bonded to the ester O on one side and CH2 on the other side.  The signal farthest upfield is also a triplet indicating the presence of an adjacent CH2 group.  The two multiplets between them each integrate to 2 H.  What is the most likely structure of the remainder of the compound?
qStmt	12		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C6H12O2 is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	12	1	Correct! Only this isomer shows a downfield 1 H sextet, a 3 H singlet, a 2 H quintet, a 3 H doublet, and an upfield 3 H triplet.
evalFeedback	12	2	That's not C6H12O2.
evalFeedback	12	3	You're very close, but the CH3 group in this compound would resonate considerably further downfield than it does in the unknown, and the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl would resonate considerably further upfield than it does in the unknown.  How else can you arrange the hydrocarbon fragments around the ester?
evalFeedback	12	4	The resonance at 4.8 ppm is not due to an alkene.  There is only one resonance in the alkene region integrating to ^1H, so it would have to be the only alkenyl H atom, and it is not possible for an alkenyl H atom that is not coupled to other alkenyl H atoms to have the number of neighbors that are evident from the splitting.  Instead, this resonance must be due to a particularly deshielded C(sp3)-H.
evalFeedback	12	5	Note the resonance about 4.8 ppm.  What functional group in a compound containing only C, H, two O, and one degree of unsaturation would give rise to a resonance with such a chemical shift?
evalFeedback	12	6	A singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H is usually indicative of an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
evalFeedback	12	7	The acetyl group uses C2H3O, leaving C4H9O left to assign.  The signal farthest downfield in the spectrum is a 1 H sextet, indicating a CH bonded to the ester O, CH3, and CH2.  The two upfield 3 H resonances represent two CH3 groups next to a CH and a CH2.  What is the most likely structure of the remainder of the compound?
qStmt	13		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C6H12O2 is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	13	1	Correct! A singlet at ~2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H indicates an acetyl group.  The downfield 2 H signal and the upfield 6 H signal are both doublets.  This indicates that the C atom bonded to the O atom and the terminal C atom are both attached to a CH group.
evalFeedback	13	2	That's not C6H12O2.
evalFeedback	13	3	You're very close, but the CH3 group in this compound would resonate considerably further downfield than it does in the unknown, and the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would resonate considerably further upfield than it does in the unknown.  How else can you arrange the hydrocarbon fragments around the ester?
evalFeedback	13	4	Note the resonance about 3.9 ppm.  What functional group in a compound containing only C, H, two O, and one degree of unsaturation would give rise to a resonance with such a chemical shift?
evalFeedback	13	5	A singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H is usually indicative of an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
evalFeedback	13	6	The acetyl group uses C2H3O, leaving C4H9O left to assign.  The signal farthest downfield in the spectrum is a 2 H triplet, indicating a CH2 bonded to O and CH.  The upfield 6 H resonance represents two CH3 groups next to a CH.  What is the most likely structure of the remainder of the compound?
qStmt	14		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C6H12O2 is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	14	1	Correct! With a molecular formula of C6H12O2, the two resonances must be in a 9:3 ratio, not 3:1.  A singlet at ~2.1 ppm integrating to 3 H indicates an acetyl group.  The group attached to the O atom is a <i>tert</i>-butyl group which gives rise to a 9 H singlet at ~1.4 ppm.
evalFeedback	14	2	That's not C6H12O2.
evalFeedback	14	3	You're very close, but the CH3 group in this compound would resonate considerably further downfield than it does in the unknown.  How else can you arrange the hydrocarbon fragments around the ester?
evalFeedback	14	4	Your spectrum has two singlets in 1:3 ratio, but the compound has twelve H atoms, so the resonances must represent how many H atoms, respectively?  To how many H atoms would the singlet at ca. 2.1 ppm integrate then, and what group would it represent?
evalFeedback	14	5	What group C4H9 would give rise to a 9 H singlet?
qStmt	15		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C4H9Br is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	15	1	Correct! The compound shows four resonances, so it must be <i>n</i>-BuBr or <i>s</i>-BuBr.  Only in <i>s</i>-BuBr does the most downfield resonance integrate to 1 H.
evalFeedback	15	2	That's not C4H9Br.
evalFeedback	15	3	This compound would show fewer than four resonances.
evalFeedback	15	4	Although this compound would show four resonances, the most downfield resonance would integrate to 2 H.
qStmt	16		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C4H9Br is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	16	1	Correct! The farthest upfield and downfield signals are triplets indicating that the C atoms have adjacent CH2 groups.
evalFeedback	16	2	That's not C4H9Br.
evalFeedback	16	3	This compound would show fewer than four resonances.
evalFeedback	16	4	Although this compound would show four resonances (actually, five, but two coincide), the most downfield resonance would integrate to only 1 H.
qStmt	17		The ^1H NMR spectrum of a compound with molecular formula C4H9Br is shown here. Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	17	1	Correct! Only this isomer shows three resonances.
evalFeedback	17	2	That's not C4H9Br.
evalFeedback	17	3	This compound would not show three resonances.

evalFeedback	1	4	What does the absence of an absorbance at 3500 cm^^-1 signify about this compound?
evalFeedback	1	5	A carboxylic acid would have a very wide OH absorbance at 3000 cm^^-1 in the IR spectrum.
evalFeedback	1	6	An aldehyde would show an absorbance around 2700 cm^^-1 for the C(sp2)-H stretch.
evalFeedback	1	7	A ketone would show a C=O stretch lower in energy than 1750 cm^^-1 .
evalFeedback	1	8	An acyl chloride would show a C=O stretch much higher in energy than 1750 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	1	9	There are three resonances in 3:3:1 ratio.  One of the 3 H resonances is a doublet, and the 1 H resonance is a quartet.  What does that tell you about the most likely structures of the small hydrocarbon fragments that contain these three types of H atoms?
evalFeedback	1	10	Close, but the singlet in the ^1H NMR spectrum of your compound would resonate at about 1.7 ppm. To which atom must the CH3 group be attached to resonate at about 3.7 ppm?

evalFeedback	2	2	That's not C4H8O2.
evalFeedback	2	3	What functional group does a strong, broad IR absorbance at ~3000 cm^^-1 and a strong IR absorbance at ~1680 cm^^-1 indicate?
evalFeedback	2	4	There is a downfield triplet of 3 H, a sextet of 2 H, and an upfield triplet of 3 H.  What does this tell you about the most likely structure of the hydrocarbon fragment that contains these three types of H atoms?
qStmt	3		C6H12O
evalFeedback	3	1	Correct!  The doublet at ~0.9 ppm suggests an isopropyl group.  There is a singlet at ~2.1 ppm and a doublet at ~2.2 ppm.  Knowing that the compound has six C atoms, the rest of the fragment is easily assigned.
evalFeedback	3	2	That's not C6H12O.
evalFeedback	3	3	What functional group does the IR absorbance at ~1710 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	3	4	There is no IR absorbance at ~2700 cm^^-1 , so the compound is not an aldehyde.
evalFeedback	3	5	What hydrocarbon fragment gives rise to a doublet at ~0.9 ppm that integrates to 6 H?
evalFeedback	3	6	You already know the structure of a three-carbon fragment out of the six-carbon compound.  There is a singlet at ~2.1 and doublet at ~2.2 ppm.  So, what would you expect the structure of the remaining three-carbon fragment to be?
qStmt	4		C6H14O
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct!  The absence of an OH absorption band in the IR spectrum and the lack of rings and #pi bonds indicated by the formula mean that the compound must be an ether.  The presence of only two ^1H NMR signals indicate the compound is highly symmetrical.

qStmt	5		C10H13NO3.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct!

evalFeedback	5	2	That's not C10H13NO3.
evalFeedback	5	3	What does the large, broad IR absorbance at 3340 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	5	4	What functional group would give rise to H NMR signals at ~7.3 ppm and ~8.2 ppm?
evalFeedback	5	5	What do the two doublets, each integrating to 2 H, in the aromatic region of the ^1H NMR spectrum suggest about the substitution pattern of the benzene ring?
evalFeedback	5	6	Look at how many heteroatoms this compound contains.  What functional group that contains most of them would account for the IR absorbance at about 1520 cm^^-1 ?
evalFeedback	5	7	What do the two triplets and two multiplets in 2:2:2:2 ratio in the C(sp3)&ndash;H portion of the ^1H NMR spectrum indicate about the structure of the nonaromatic C atoms?
evalFeedback	5	8	Your answer is not unreasonable, but the aromatic H atoms would resonate much further upfield if an electron-donating OH group were attached to the ring instead of a very electron-withdrawing NO2 group.  Also, phenol OH groups usually are found around 5 ppm and are usually quite sharp.
evalFeedback	5	9	What do the two signals at 7.3 and 8.1 ppm indicate about the substitution pattern on the benzene ring?
qStmt	6		C11H14O2
evalFeedback	6	1	Correct! The absorption bands at ~1700 cm^^-1 and 2700 cm^^-1 indicate an aldehyde.  The two doublets at ~7.0 and ~7.8 ppm indicate a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. The two triplets and two multiplets indicate an unbranched substituent.

evalFeedback	4	1	Very good! The molecular ion of <i>m/z</i> 117 suggests the presence of an odd number of N atoms. The characteristic C#tripleN triple bond appears at 2250 cm^^-1 , and the aromatic C=C bond is suggested by the IR absorbance at 1600 cm^^-1 . Five aromatic protons are shown in the NMR at 7.3 ppm.  A singlet due to a CH2 group appears at 3.7 ppm.  All this information indicates that the structure is phenylacetonitrile.

qStmt	5		The following spectra are taken from a compound that is an important starting material for organic synthesis. Determine its structure considering all the spectra together.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good! The peak at 1685 cm^^-1 indicates a carbonyl that is conjugated with a C=C bond. The presence of an O atom and a molecular ion of 96 lead to a formula of C6H8O, with three elements of unsaturation. The C NMR spectrum indicates that three CH2 groups, two alkene CH groups, and a carbonyl are present. The structure you have drawn corresponds to all three spectra.
evalFeedback	5	2	What does the MS tell you about the exact mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	5	3	What does the MS suggest about the presence of N, Cl, or Br atoms?
evalFeedback	5	4	What functional group does the IR absorbance around 1700 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	5	5	We know so far that there is an O atom in the molecule (because there is a carbonyl group) and that the exact mass is 96. What is the most likely molecular formula of this compound?
evalFeedback	5	6	Look at the NMR spectrum. What do the two downfield resonances tell you about a functional group present in this compound?  Note: The resonance at about 7.05 ppm is not an aromatic resonance.  It is slightly downfield from where it is normally found.
evalFeedback	5	7	I see you have a carbonyl group and a double bond in your structure already. Carbonyl groups show a signal usually around 1700 cm^^-1 . Now the peak is at a lower wavenumber (1685 cm^^-1 ) and is a very intense peak. What does this suggest about the kind of carbonyl group in the compound?
evalFeedback	5	8	The compound has three resonances in the aliphatic region of the ^1H NMR spectrum, each integrating to 2 H (the 4 H resonance at 2.4 ppm is really two 2 H resonances), and two in the alkene region, each integrating to 1 H.  You must draw a structure consistent with this information.
qStmt	6		Determine the structure of the following compound based on its mass, IR, and ^1H NMR spectra.
evalFeedback	6	1	Correct! The IR spectrum indicates a ketone; the mass spectrum indicates a ketone with seven C atoms.  The presence of only three ^1H NMR signals (symmetrical ketone) and the splitting pattern confirms the structure.
evalFeedback	6	2	What does the MS tell you about the exact mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	6	3	Although the integrations in the ^1H NMR spectrum add up to 7, all it means is that the number of H atoms in the compound must be a multiple of 7.
evalFeedback	6	4	What does the MS suggest about the presence of N, Cl, or Br atoms?

evalFeedback	6	9	There is a downfield triplet integrating to 3 H, a sextet integrating to 2 H and an upfield triplet integrating to 3 H.  What does this tell you about the most likely structure of the hydrocarbon fragment that contains these three types of H atoms?
evalFeedback	6	10	This compound would not show three resonances in the ^1H NMR spectrum. The fact there are only three resonances in the ^1H NMR spectrum in a ratio of 2:2:3 indicates that the compound is a symmetrical ketone. Try again.
qStmt	7		Determine the structure of the following compound based on its mass, IR, and ^1H NMR spectra.
evalFeedback	7	1	Correct! The IR spectrum indicates a ketone; the M+2 peak tells you the compound contains Cl. The NMR spectrum indicates it has a monosubstituted benzene ring. The singlet at 4.7 ppm suggests that the group giving this signal is in a strongly electron-withdrawing environment.
evalFeedback	7	2	What does the MS tell you about the exact mass of the compound?
evalFeedback	7	3	Notice the M+2 peak in the MS. What does the presence of this peak signify?
evalFeedback	7	4	What does the MS suggest about the presence of N or Br atoms?
evalFeedback	7	5	What functional group does the IR absorbance around 1700 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	7	6	An ester would absorb at higher energy in the IR spectrum than is observed.
evalFeedback	7	7	Does the IR spectrum show absorption bands at 1735 and 2700 cm^^-1 ? These values would be characteristic of an aldehyde group.
evalFeedback	7	8	The IR spectrum reveals that there is an O atom in the molecule (because there is a carbonyl group), and the MS reveals that there is a Cl atom and that the exact mass is 154. What is the most likely molecular formula of this compound?
evalFeedback	7	9	In the NMR spectrum, there are three signals at 7-8 ppm. What functional group should be present in your molecule?
evalFeedback	7	10	In the NMR spectrum, there are three signals in the aromatic region in the ratio of 2:1:2. What does this tell you about the degree of substitution on the benzene ring?

evalFeedback	2	15	A cyclopropanone will absorb at higher than 1780 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	2	16	Good!  The MS information tells you that the compound has the formula C6H9ClO.  The IR tells you that the compound is probably a ketone (but not one that is conjugated or in a five-membered or smaller ring), and a C=C #pi bond is unlikely to be present.
qStmt	3		A compound has an M^+ ion at 132 amu. There is a peak at 133 amu whose intensity is 6.6% of the M^+ peak and one at 134 amu whose intensity is 33% of the M^+ peak.

evalFeedback	3	18	Because of its symmetry, this compound would show only four resonances in the 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	3	19	Because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the Cl atom, this compound would show an IR absorbance significantly larger than 1715 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	3	20	Good!  The compound, C6H9ClO, has two degrees of unsaturation.  One is a ketone, and the lack of alkene IR and 13C NMR absorbances and CH3 groups suggests that the other is a six-membered ring.  We rule out 4-chlorocyclohexanone because its symmetry would lead to only four 13C NMR resonances.  We rule out 2-chlorocyclohexanone because the Cl atom so close to the ketone would cause the latter's IR absorbance to increase substantially from 1715 cm^^-1.  That leaves 3-chlorocyclohexanone as the only possibility.

qStmt	26		A compound has an M^+ ion at 102 amu.  There is no M+2 peak.  The only IR absorbances in the interpretable region are at 3500 and 2900 cm^^-1. The 13C NMR spectrum shows three resonances at #delta 70 (d), 35 (t), and 30 (t). The ^1H NMR spectrum shows four resonances at #delta 4.0 (dd, 1H), 1.5 (m, 2H), 1.3 (m, 1H), and a fourth broad resonance that varies with concentration and temperature (1H).  The compound is optically inactive, but it can be separated into two enantiomers. Draw a structure consistent with this information.
evalFeedback	26	1	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	26	2	Good!  Only this stereoisomer could consist of two enantiomers.

evalFeedback	26	5	The IR and NMR spectra show no signs of any N-containing functional groups.
evalFeedback	26	6	The 13C NMR spectrum reveals that there are no CH3 groups.  A compound with formula C6H14O must have at least one CH3 group (no rings or #pi bonds).

evalFeedback	26	7	What does the IR absorbance at 3500 cm^^-1 signify?
evalFeedback	26	8	If the compound contained a carbonyl group, it would have a strong absorbance in the 1700 cm^^-1 region.
evalFeedback	26	9	The lack of an absorbance at 3000&ndash;3100 cm^^-1 makes it unlikely that an alkene is present.

evalFeedback	26	14	If the compound had this structure, it would show two resonances in the 60&ndash;70 ppm region, not just one.
evalFeedback	26	15	If this were the structure of the compound, the downfield resonance would be a dddd, not a dd.
evalFeedback	26	16	If this were the structure of the compound, the resonances would integrate to 1:4:4:1.
evalFeedback	26	17	What does the ability to separate its enantiomers signify about the structure of this compound?

Topic: NMR spectroscopy; Set: 13C NMR
qStmt	1		Click on the TMS peak.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!
evalFeedback	1	2	No, that's the alcohol peak.
evalFeedback	1	3	No, try again.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please click near a peak.
qStmt	2		The molecular formula of a compound is C6H12O.  Determine the structure of the compound based on its molecular formula and its 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! The compound has only four resonances, so it must have some symmetry.  With one degree of unsaturation and no sign of #pi bonds, it is likely cyclic.  The resonance at 71 ppm is characteristic of CHOH, and the three different CH2 groups resonate in the region of 24-36 ppm.
evalFeedback	2	2	That's not C6H12O.
evalFeedback	2	3	Where does the C atom of the C=O group usually resonate in the 13C NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	2	4	The C atoms of the C=C bond usually resonate in the region of 100-150 ppm.  Are there any signals in that region in your spectrum?
evalFeedback	2	5	The compound you've drawn shows more than four signals in the ^^1^^3 C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	2	6	A methyl group would resonate considerably further upfield than any resonances observed in the unknown.
evalFeedback	2	7	There are only four signals for this six-carbon compound.  What does this tell you about the symmetry of the molecule?
qStmt	3		Identify the compound with molecular formula C3H5Cl3 that gives the following 13C NMR spectrum.  (The resonance at 0 ppm is due to the TMS standard, not the unknown.)
evalFeedback	3	1	Correct! All three C atoms are inequivalent and produce three signals in the 13C NMR spectrum.  The resonance at 85 ppm is in about the same range as CDCl3, suggesting that it, too, is attached to three Cl atoms. Its small height relative to the other peaks also suggests a quaternary C atom.
evalFeedback	3	2	You're warm, but not quite there. The chemical shift and relative height of the resonance at about 85 ppm suggests what about this C atom?
evalFeedback	3	3	That's not C3H5Cl3.
qStmt	4		Identify the compound with molecular formula C7H14O that gives the following proton-coupled 13C NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct! The singlet at 210 ppm is indicative of a carbonyl group.  The splitting of other two signals indicates an isopropyl group.  Therefore, from the molecular formula and the number of signals, we can conclude that the molecule is a symmetrical ketone with two isopropyl groups.
evalFeedback	4	2	That's not C7H14O.
evalFeedback	4	3	There is a singlet at 210 ppm.  What kind of C atoms usually appear in that region?
evalFeedback	4	4	The singlet at 210 ppm indicates what functional group?  How many H atoms are attached to that C atom?
evalFeedback	4	5	What do a quartet and a doublet in a proton-coupled 13C NMR spectrum indicate about the hydrocarbon fragment present in the molecule?
evalFeedback	4	6	There are only two kinds of C(sp3) in this seven-carbon compound.  One is CH, and the other is CH3.  The compound must be highly symmetrical.
qStmt	5		Identify the compound with molecular formula C6H10O that is responsible for the following DEPT 13C NMR spectrum.  This problem has more than one correct answer.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct! The DEPT spectrum has five C atoms bonded to H atoms.  The molecular formula tells us that the compound has six C atoms and an O atom.  The sixth C atom not bonded to a H atom indicates the presence of a ketone functional group.  The fact that one C(sp2) has one H attached and the other has two tells us that the compound has a double bond at the terminal position of the chain, and the presence of only one CH3 group tells us that the compound is linear.  The fact that the C(sp2) resonances are not shifted further downfield tells us that the C=C bond is not conjugated to the ketone.  The answer may be 5-hexen-2-one or 5-hexen-3-one.
evalFeedback	5	2	Very close!  The DEPT spectrum has five C atoms bonded to H atoms.  The molecular formula tells us that the compound has six C atoms and an O atom.  The sixth C atom not bonded to a H atom indicates the presence of a ketone functional group.  The fact that one C(sp2) has one H attached and the other has two tells us that the compound has a double bond at the terminal position of the chain, and the presence of only one CH3 group tells us that the compound is linear.  However, the fact that the C(sp2) resonances are not shifted further downfield tells us that the C=C bond is not conjugated to the ketone.
evalFeedback	5	3	The molecular formula of the compound is given as C6H10O.  The molecular formula of this structure is not C6H10O.
evalFeedback	5	4	What kind of C atoms absorb in the 120-140 ppm region of the 13C NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	5	5	The DEPT spectrum has five C atoms bonded to H atoms.  The molecular formula tells us that the compound has six C atoms and an O atom.  The sixth C atom not bonded to a H atom indicates the presence of what functional group?
evalFeedback	5	6	There are one CH2 and one CH in the alkene region of the DEPT spectrum.
evalFeedback	5	7	Your response must have one CH3 group, two C(sp3)H2 groups, a CH2=CH group, and a ketone.
Topic: NMR spectroscopy; Set: Identify by ^1H and 13C NMR
qStmt	1		A small pilot plant was adding bromine across the double bond of 2-butene to make 2,3-dibromobutane. A controller malfunction allowed the reaction temperature to rise beyond safe limits. A careful distillation of the product showed that several impurities had formed, including the one whose NMR spectra appear below. Determine its structure.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct! The double bond is gone (no vinyl H atoms), and the integration shows eight H atoms so the formula must be C4H8Br2. The four C atoms must be in a straight chain because the starting material was 2-butene. From the integration, the four C atoms must be present as one CH3, one CH, and two CH2 groups. The only isomer with these characteristics is 1,3-dibromobutane, the one you drew.
evalFeedback	1	2	Look at the integration of the ^1H NMR signals. How many H atoms should be in your compound?
evalFeedback	1	3	Where would H atoms attached to C(sp2) resonate? Are there any resonances in this region of the ^1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	1	4	No C-C bonds are formed or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	5	How many Br atoms should be present in a compound with four C atoms, eight H atoms, no rings, and no #pi bonds?
evalFeedback	1	6	This compound is symmetrical.  How many ^1H NMR resonances does it have?  How many are in the spectrum of the impurity?
evalFeedback	1	7	This compound would show a sharp singlet for the isolated CH3 group.  Does the spectrum have such a resonance?
evalFeedback	1	8	This compound would show an upfield triplet of 3 H for the CH3 group.  Does the spectrum have such a resonance?
evalFeedback	1	9	This compound is the expected product, not the impurity.
qStmt	2		When 2-chloro-2-methylbutane is treated with a variety of strong bases, the products always seem to contain two isomers (A and B) of formula C5H10. When NaOH is used as the base, isomer A predominates. When potassium <i>t</i>-butoxide is used as the base, isomer B predominates. The ^1H and 13C NMR spectra of isomer A are given below. Determine its structure.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right! NaOH is a small base so the more substituted double bond is formed. It has only one vinylic H atom and 9 H atoms from CH3 groups, exactly like in the ^1H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	2	2	How many C(sp2)&ndash;H atoms are in your structure?  How many are in the NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	2	3	The compound you drew doesn't have the molecular formula C5H10.
evalFeedback	2	4	What functional group is formed when an alkyl chloride is treated with a base?
evalFeedback	2	5	No C-C bonds are broken or formed in this reaction.
qStmt	3		When 2-chloro-2-methylbutane is treated with a variety of strong bases, the products always seem to contain two isomers (A and B) of formula C5H10. When NaOH is used as the base, isomer A predominates. When potassium <i>t</i>-butoxide is used as the base, isomer B predominates. The ^1H and 13C NMR spectra of isomer B are given below.  Draw its structure.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right! <i>t</i>-Butoxide is a bulky base, so the least substituted double bond is formed. It has two vinylic H atoms, exactly as shown in the ^1H NMR spectrum.
evalFeedback	3	2	How many C(sp2)&ndash;H atoms are in your structure?  How many are in the NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	3	3	The compound you drew doesn't have the molecular formula C5H10.
evalFeedback	3	4	No C-C bonds are broken or formed in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	5	What functional group is formed when an alkyl chloride is treated with a base?
qStmt	4		A compound with formula C10H10O gives rise to the following 600 MHz 1H NMR and 150 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT spectra. Draw the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	4	4	The compound must have the formula C10H10O.
evalFeedback	4	5	What functional group is signified by the resonances at 7&#8211;8 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	6	If this compound were an aldehyde, the resonance at 200 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum would appear in the DEPT-90 and DEPT-135 spectra, but it does not.
evalFeedback	4	7	What functional group is signified by the resonance at about 200 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	8	The 1H NMR spectrum does not show a resonance that integrates to 3, so the compound cannot contain a CH3 group.
evalFeedback	4	9	This compound would show a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum around 3 ppm, but no singlet is observed.
evalFeedback	4	10	What kind of benzene substitution pattern is indicated by the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	11	Sorry, try again.
qStmt	5		A compound with formula C8H9NO2 gives rise to the following 600 MHz 1H NMR and 150 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT spectra. Draw the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good! The unsaturation index of 5 and both spectra clearly indicate an aromatic ring. The quartet at 4.3 ppm and the triplet at 1.2 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, and the quaternary C at 165 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum, clearly indicate an ethyl ester.  Subtracting CO2Et from C8H9NO2, we are left with C5H4N, which, if aromatic, is most consistent with a pyridyl group. The number of aromatic resonances in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra rules out ethyl 4-pyridinecarboxylate, and the fact that the most downfield resonance in the 1H NMR spectrum shows only very small coupling constants suggests that the ester is on the 3-position of the ring.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	5	4	The compound should have the formula C8H9NO2.
evalFeedback	5	5	What substructure do the quartet at 4.3 ppm and the triplet at 1.2 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, and the quaternary C at 165 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum, clearly indicate?
evalFeedback	5	6	You have already realized that the compound contains a CO2Et group. Subtract CO2Et from the formula to find the remaining atoms that you must arrange. What kind of functional group is indicated by the resonance at 7&#8211;9 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum and those at 120&#8211;160 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum? How can you arrange your remaining atoms to make this kind of functional group?
evalFeedback	5	7	Due to symmetry, this compound would show many fewer resonances than are observed.
evalFeedback	5	8	In the 1H NMR spectrum of this compound, every aromatic resonance would show at least one coupling of about 8 Hz. What isomer is more consistent with the observed coupling constants?
qStmt	6		A compound with formula C6H10O gives rise to the following 600 MHz 1H NMR and 150 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT spectra. Draw the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good! The 13C NMR spectrum clearly indicates a ketone. The formula indicates an unsaturation index of 2, and the 13C NMR spectrum shows no additional &#960; bonds, so the compound contains a ring. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a single CH3 group attached to a CH group, which suggests that the remaining C atoms are in the ring. The only compounds that fit these criteria are 2- and 3-methylcyclopentanone. The latter compound would show two dd for the two H(2) atoms; no such pattern is observed, so the compound is most likely the former.
evalFeedback	6	2	Close. If this were the compound, you would observe two dd for the two H(2) atoms. No such patterns are observed in this spectrum, so the compound is probably an isomer.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	6	5	The compound has the formula C6H10O.
evalFeedback	6	6	What functional group is signified by the 13C NMR resonance at 220 ppm and its absence from the DEPT-90 and DEPT-135 spectra?
evalFeedback	6	7	A formula of C6H10O gives an unsaturation index of 2, one of which is used by the ketone. What does the absence of peaks from 120&#8211;160 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum tell you about how the remaining degree of unsaturation is manifested in this compound?
evalFeedback	6	8	What does the integration and multiplicity of the most upfield resonance of the 1H NMR spectrum tell you about the structure of this compound?
qStmt	7		A compound with formula C8H14O2 gives rise to the following IR, 300 MHz 1H NMR, and 75 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT spectra. Draw the structure of the compound.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good! The IR and 13C NMR spectra indicate an ester, and the resonances at 5&#8211;6 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum indicate a terminal alkene attached to a quaternary allylic C atom. The 1H NMR spectrum also indicates a gem-dimethyl group as well as a CH2 group with no coupling to its neighbors.
evalFeedback	7	2	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	7	4	The compound's formula must be C8H14O2.
evalFeedback	7	5	What is signified by the IR absorbance at 1737 cm^^-1 and the resonance at 172.0 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum that is absent from both DEPT spectra?
evalFeedback	7	6	What is signified by the three downfield dd in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	7	What does the multiplicity of the resonance at 5.9 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum tell you about the number of H atoms on the allylic C atom?
evalFeedback	7	8	What is signified by the multiplicity and integration of the resonance at 1.13 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	9	What is signified by the chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity of the resonance at 3.62 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	7	10	You're close, but not there. Try again.

qStmt	1		A compound with formula C10H18O gives rise to the following 600 MHz 1H NMR, 150 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT, HMQC, COSY, HMBC, and INADEQUATE spectra. Draw the structure of the compound. Note: The 2D spectra, while helpful, are not absolutely necessary for solving this problem.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! The formula C10H18O reveals two degrees of unsaturation. The 13C NMR spectrum contains only one C(sp3)&#8211;O resonance, and the C is quaternary, while the broad resonance at 2.25 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum suggests an alcohol.  The 1H NMR reveals a terminal double bond attached to a quaternary C, as well as another double bond that appears to be part of a (CH3)2C=CHCH2 group. There are a total of three CH3 groups and two CH2 groups. The best fit is linalool.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	1	4	The compound has a formula of C10H18O.
evalFeedback	1	5	What does the 13C NMR spectrum tell you about the functional group containing the O atom?

evalFeedback	1	11	Given that the terminal alkene substructure gives rise to three dd in the 1H NMR spectrum, what do you know about the C atom to which the vinyl group is attached?
evalFeedback	1	12	What substructure does the triplet of septets at 5.0 ppm signify?
evalFeedback	1	13	Given that the trisubstituted alkene substructure gives rise to a triplet of septets in the 1H NMR spectrum with <i>J</i><sub>t</sub> &asymp; 5 Hz and <i>J</i><sub>septet</sub> &asymp; 1 Hz, what do you know about the C atom adjacent to the trisubstituted alkene's CH group?
evalFeedback	1	14	What interaction must be causing the splitting of the resonance at 5.0 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum into a triplet of septets with <i>J</i><sub>septet</sub> &asymp; 1 Hz? What does this splitting signify about the groups attached to the fully substituted C of the trisubstituted alkene?
evalFeedback	1	15	What do the DEPT spectra signify about the C atom bearing the OH group?
evalFeedback	1	16	The 1H NMR spectrum contains three resonances integrating to 3H. What do their multiplicities signify about the C atoms to which they are attached?
evalFeedback	1	17	No cigar, but you must be close. You have correctly concluded that you have a quaternary C(sp3)&#8211;OH group, an Me2C=CHCH2 group, and a CH2=CHC(quat) group, and all Me groups are attached to C atoms bearing no H atoms as well. There aren't a whole lot of possibilities left for C10H18O.
qStmt	2		A compound with formula C11H16O gives rise to the following 300 MHz 1H NMR, 75 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT, HETCOR, and COSY spectra. Its IR spectrum shows strong bands at 1700 and 1648 cm^^-1.  Draw a structure that is consistent with the provided information.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good! This compound is responsible for the odor of jasmine. From the information that's given, it's not possible to tell whether the methyl group is on C(2) and the pentenyl group is on C(3), or vice versa.
evalFeedback	2	2	Close! You can't tell from the information you're given, but the observed coupling constant between the two resonances at 5.2&#8211;5.4 ppm is considerably smaller than one would expect in the compound you drew. How can you change the structure to give you a smaller expected coupling constant?
evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	2	4	Please draw an uncharged compound.
evalFeedback	2	5	The compound has the formula C11H16O.
evalFeedback	2	6	What does the resonance at 209 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum signify? Consider also the absence of this peak from the DEPT spectra.
evalFeedback	2	7	How many &#960;&#160;bonds are signified by the 13C NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	2	8	How many degrees of unsaturation does this compound have? How many &#960;&#160;bonds are signified by the 13C NMR spectrum? So how many rings must this compound contain?
evalFeedback	2	9	What is signified by the fact that one of the alkene resonances in the 13C NMR spectrum is so far downfield compared to the other alkene resonances? Consider how another functional group that must be present in this compound could affect the chemical shift in this way.
evalFeedback	2	10	The IR absorbance of this #a,#b-unsaturated ketone would be considerably higher in energy than 1700 cm^^-1.
evalFeedback	2	11	An #a,#b-unsaturated carbonyl compound usually has an IR absorbance below 1700 cm^^-1. What feature could the ketone have that would cause this compound's carbonyl IR absorbance to appear at higher energy?
evalFeedback	2	12	What group is signified by the two most downfield resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	2	13	What is signified by the absence of two alkene C atoms from the DEPT spectra?
evalFeedback	2	14	What does the integration and multiplicity of the most upfield resonance in the 1H NMR spectrum signify?
evalFeedback	2	15	Consider the resonance at 2.94 ppm in the 1H NMR and COSY spectra. What does its integration, its multiplicity, and its strongest COSY cross-peak tell you about the chemical environment of the H atoms that give rise to this resonance?
evalFeedback	2	16	You must be warm. Your compound has the formula C11H16O, and it contains a 2-cyclopentenone, a disubstituted alkene, a tetrasubstituted alkene, a CH2CH3 group, and a CH2 group between the two alkenes. Use the COSY and HETCOR spectra to put the pieces together.
qStmt	3		In the previous question, the provided NMR data were insufficient to determine which of the two regioisomers shown was the compound. Choose the 2D NMR experiment or experiments that would allow you to tell unambiguously which isomer you have, and explain what features (or absence of features) of the spectra would rule out one of the structures.

qStmt	4		A compound with formula C10H8O3 gives rise to the following 300 MHz 1H NMR, 75 MHz 13C NMR and DEPT, and COSY spectra. Its IR spectrum shows strong bands at 1720 and 1620 cm^^-1. Draw a structure that is consistent with the provided information.

evalFeedback	4	4	What group is signified by the singlet at 3.9 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum?
evalFeedback	4	5	What group is signified by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm^^-1?
evalFeedback	4	6	You're right that the compound contains a naphthalene ring with one of the C atoms replaced with O, and you're right that another C atom bears a carbonyl group. What is incorrect is the relative orientation of the ring O and the carbonyl group. Both should be in the same ring.
evalFeedback	4	7	You have drawn a compound with an isochromen-3-one aromatic nucleus. Such compounds are pretty reactive, and the unknown is unlikely to have this structure. Try moving around the O or carbonyl groups.
evalFeedback	4	8	What structure has the formula C9H5O2(OMe) and has only aromatic H atoms (other than in the OMe group)?
evalFeedback	4	9	Good! Your response is consistent with the provided data, although there are other reasonable answers as well. The COSY spectrum and the coupling constants show that one ring bears two H atoms, whereas the other bears three, one of which engages only in long-range coupling to the other two. The six compounds consistent with this information are 6- and 7-methoxy-2-chromenone, 4-chromenone, and 1-isochromenone.
evalFeedback	4	10	The COSY spectrum and the coupling constants tell you the position of the MeO group on the aromatic nucleus.

H(7&#8211;9) are assigned by their chemical shifts and coupling constants. H(6) and H(2) are assigned by their chemical shifts, and they are differentiated by their multiplicty and also by the fact that only H(6) would correlate to H(7) in the COSY spectrum.

The spectra were taken in DMSO-<i>d</i><sub>6</sub> on a 500 MHz spectrometer.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good! The OH groups don't undergo H atom exchange in this spectrum, so coupling is observed for them. H^2 and H^3 give rise to 1H NMR resonances d and g. To distinguish them, you can calculate the coupling constants of the two resonances, and you can determine which values must correspond to <i>J</i><sub>2&#8211;4</sub> and <i>J</i><sub>3&#8211;4</sub>. Assuming that the compound resides mostly in the conformation shown in the figure, you can use the Karplus relation to determine which of H^2 and H^3 must give rise to d, and which to f.
evalFeedback	12	2	Almost there! H^2 and H^3 give rise to 1H NMR resonances d and g, but it's difficult to distinguish them. You can calculate the coupling constants of the two resonances, and you can determine which values must correspond to <i>J</i><sub>2&#8211;4</sub> and <i>J</i><sub>3&#8211;4</sub>. Assuming that the compound resides mostly in the conformation shown in the figure, you can use the Karplus relation to determine which of H^2 and H^3 must give rise to d, and which to f.
evalFeedback	12	3	In these spectra, the OH groups don't undergo H atom exchange, and the H atoms attached to O participate in three-bond coupling to H atoms attached to C.

evalFeedback	12	4	In these spectra, the OH groups don't undergo H atom exchange, and the H atoms attached to O participate in three-bond coupling to H atoms attached to C. Use the HSQC spectrum to determine which H atoms are attached to O and which to C. Among the H atoms attached to C, which must be the triplet?
evalFeedback	12	5	You know that H^6 gives rise to 1H NMR resonance e, and H^6 is attached to C^3. Use the HSQC spectrum to determine which 13C NMR resonance corresponds to C^3.
evalFeedback	12	6	Only C^1 is attached to two H atoms. Use the HSQC spectrum to determine which 13C NMR resonance corresponds to C^1.

evalFeedback	12	8	You have correctly assigned the resonances of C^2, and H^4 is attached to C^2. Use the HSQC spectrum to determine which 1H NMR resonance must correspond to H^4.
evalFeedback	12	9	You have correctly assigned the resonance of H^4, and H^4 is coupled to H^5, so use the COSY spectrum to assign the correct resonance to H^5.
evalFeedback	12	10	You have correctly assigned the resonance of H^6, and H^6 is coupled to H^7, so use the COSY spectrum to assign the correct resonance to H^7.
evalFeedback	12	11	You have correctly assigned the resonances of C^1, and H^2 and H^3 are attached to C^1. Use the HSQC spectrum to determine which 1H NMR resonances must correspond to H^2 and H^3. (You can't determine which of the two resonances must be H^2 and which must be H^3.)
evalFeedback	12	12	Both 1H NMR resonances d and g integrate to one H, so you cannot assign either one to two different H atoms.
qStmt	13		The compound shown twice in Figure 1 gives rise to the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, and HSQC spectra shown in Figures 2&#8211;5. Figure 6 shows the same compound in its lowest energy conformation. Assign each 1H NMR resonance (letters a&#8211;f) and 13C NMR resonance (letters a&#8211;g) to the appropriate H (numbers 1&#8211;6 on the top structure) or C atom (numbers 1&#8211;7 on the bottom structure). The spectra were taken in CD3OD on a 500 MHz spectrometer.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good! One of H^5 and H^6 must be axial and the other equatorial, so we should be able to use coupling constants to tell which of H^5 and H^6 corresponds to 1H NMR resonance e, and which to f, but unfortunately, the data don't allow it. The problem is that this compound assumes a conformation in which H^4 is equatorial, giving rise to <i>J</i><sub>4&#8211;5</sub> and <i>J</i><sub>4&#8211;6</sub> values that are very similar (4.9 and 5.6 Hz), and making it impossible to tell which of H^5 and H^6 is axial, and which equatorial.

evalFeedback	13	8	1H NMR resonances e and f both integrate to one H, so neither can represent more than one H atom.
evalFeedback	13	9	H^2, H^3, and H^4 have similar chemical shifts, but they differ in which other H atoms they are coupled to. Use the COSY spectrum to determine which 1H NMR resonance represents H^2.
evalFeedback	13	10	H^2, H^3, and H^4 have similar chemical shifts, but they differ in which other H atoms they are coupled to. Use the COSY spectrum to determine which 1H NMR resonance represents H^4.
evalFeedback	13	11	If resonance b represents H^2 and resonance c represents H^4, which resonance must represent H^3?
evalFeedback	13	12	You have already assigned the 1H NMR resonance that represents H^2, and H^2 is attached to C^4, so use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^4.
evalFeedback	13	13	You have already assigned the 1H NMR resonance that represents H^4, and H^4 is attached to C^6, so use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^6.
evalFeedback	13	14	You have already assigned the 1H NMR resonance that represents H^3, and H^3 is attached to C^5, so use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^5.
qStmt	14		The compound shown twice in Figure 1 gives rise to the 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, and HSQC spectra shown in the remaining figures. Assign each 1H NMR resonance (letters a&#8211;l) and 13C NMR resonance (letters a&#8211;j) to the appropriate H (numbers 1&#8211;13 on the top structure) or C atom (numbers 1&#8211;10 on the bottom structure).

However, once you have chosen randomly which 1H NMR resonance corresponds to H^12 and which to H^13, the 13C NMR resonances that correspond to C^9 and C^10 will follow logically.</li></ul>
evalFeedback	14	1	Well done! You know that 1H NMR resonance a must be H^7, and 13C NMR resonance a must be C^3. H^7 must be coupled to H^6, H^8, and H^9; the COSY spectrum shows that they must correspond to 1H NMR resonances c, g, and h. The HSQC spectrum shows that 1H NMR resonances c and h correlate to the single 13C NMR resonance c, so they must correspond to H^8 and H^9, 1H NMR resonance g must correspond to H^6, 13C NMR resonance c must correspond to C^2, and 13C NMR resonance b must correspond to C^4. Having identified methine C atoms C^3 and C^4, we have only two more methine H/C pairs, H^1/C^1 and H^11/C^8, to identify. The HSQC spectrum shows that 13C NMR resonances e and f correlate to only one H atom each, so they must be C^1 and C^8. They correlate to 1H NMR resonances b and f. The COSY spectrum shows that resonance b is coupled to CH3 resonances i and l, whereas resonance f is coupled only to CH3 resonance j, so 1H NMR resonance b must correspond to H^11, 1H NMR resonance f to H^1, 13C NMR resonance e to C^1, and 13C NMR resonance f to C^8. Furthermore, 1H NMR CH3 resonance j must correspond to H^10, and 1H NMR CH3 resonances i and l must correspond to H^12 and H^13. The HSQC spectrum then shows that 13C NMR resonance h must correspond to C^7, and 13C NMR resonances i and j must correspond to C^9 and C^10. The COSY spectrum makes it possible to assign H^2/H^3 to 1H NMR resonances d and k and H^4/H^5 to e and h, and the HSQC spectrum then makes it possible to complete the 13C NMR assignments with resonances d and g corresponding to C^6 and C^5, respectively. What remains is to distinguish H^8 from H^9, H^2 from H^3, and H4 from H^5. In every case, you can expect the equatorial H atom to have one large coupling constant (geminal) and several small ones , whereas the axial H atom will have at least two large coupling constants (geminal and 1,2-diaxial). These features allow us to assign resonances H^2, H^4, and H^8 to resonances d, e, and c, respectively, and H^3, H^5, and H^9 to resonances k, h, and h, respectively. Note that in each axial/equatorial pair, the equatorial H is further downfield by about 1 ppm. This phenomenon is due to the torus of electron density produced by the six #sigma bonds of the ring.
evalFeedback	14	2	Which 1H NMR resonance corresponds to H^7?
evalFeedback	14	3	Which 13C NMR resonance corresponds to C^3?
evalFeedback	14	4	Use the COSY spectrum to identify which resonances are coupled to H^7; they must correspond to H^6, H^8, and H^9. In the HSQC spectrum, the 1H NMR resonance due to H^8 and H^9 will correlate to the same 13C NMR resonance, and the 1H NMR resonance due to H^6 will correlate to a different 13C NMR resonance. So which 1H NMR resonance must correspond to H^6?
evalFeedback	14	5	You know which 1H NMR resonance corresponds to H^6, so which 13C NMR resonance must correspond to C^4?
evalFeedback	14	6	You know which 1H NMR resonances correspond to H^8 and H^9, so which 13C NMR resonance must correspond to C^2?
evalFeedback	14	7	You have identified methine C atoms C^3 and C^4, so you have only two more methine H/C pairs, H^1/C^1 and H^11/C^8, to identify. Which unassigned 13C NMR resonances does the HSQC spectrum show correlate to only one H atom each, and to which 1H NMR resonances do they correlate? What feature of the COSY spectrum can you use to distinguish the two 1H NMR resonances, and hence their corresponding 13C NMR resonances?
evalFeedback	14	8	You have already identified the resonance that corresponds to H^1. Use the COSY spectrum to assign H^10.
evalFeedback	14	9	You have already identified the resonance that corresponds to H^10. Use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^7.
evalFeedback	14	10	You have already identified the resonance that corresponds to H^11. Use the COSY spectrum to assign H^12 and H^13.
evalFeedback	14	11	You need to assign resonance i to H^12 and resonance l to H^13, or vice versa. You can't assign one resonance to both H^12 and H^13.
evalFeedback	14	12	You have already identified the resonance that corresponds to H^12. Use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^9.
evalFeedback	14	13	You have already identified the resonance that corresponds to H^13. Use the HSQC spectrum to assign C^10.
evalFeedback	14	14	You have already determined which 1H NMR resonance corresponds to H^6. H^6 must couple to H^4, H^5, H^7, and H^11. Use the COSY spectrum to identify the 1H NMR resonances corresponding to H^4 and H^5, and then use the HSQC spectrum to identify the 13C NMR resonance corresponding to C^5.
evalFeedback	14	15	You have assigned all of the 13C atoms except for C^6. Which 13C NMR resonance must correspond to it?
evalFeedback	14	16	Use the COSY spectrum to identify which resonances are coupled to H^7; they must correspond to H^6, H^8, and H^9. In the HSQC spectrum, the 1H NMR resonance due to H^8 and H^9 will correlate to the same 13C NMR resonance, and the 1H NMR resonance due to H^6 will correlate to a different 13C NMR resonance. So which 1H NMR resonances must correspond to H^8 and H^9?
evalFeedback	14	17	You have already determined which 1H NMR resonance corresponds to H^6. H^6 must couple to H^4, H^5, H^7, and H^11, and you have also already determined which 1H NMR resonances correspond to H^7 and H^11, so use the COSY spectrum to identify the 1H NMR resonances corresponding to H^4 and H^5.
evalFeedback	14	18	You have assigned all of the H atoms except for H^2 and H^3. Which 1H NMR resonances must correspond to them?
evalFeedback	14	19	You have identified the pair of 1H NMR resonances corresponding to H^2 and H^3, the pair corresponding to H^4 and H^5, and the pair corresponding to H^8 and H^9. Within each pair, one H atom is axial, and one is equatorial. Determine the expected number of large vs. small coupling constants that each H atom wil display. Then, within each pair of resonances, determine which one is more likely to correspond to the axial atom, and which to the equatorial one.

evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  This six-electron electrocyclic ring closure occurs in disrotatory fashion under thermal conditions to give this bicyclic diene.
evalFeedback	6	2	Under thermal conditions, a six-electron electrocyclic reaction does not occur in conrotatory fashion.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please specify the stereochemistry of the product at the ring fusion.
evalFeedback	6	4	Your answer is not unreasonable, but a considerably less strained compound can be made by a different electrocyclic ring closure.
evalFeedback	6	5	This compound is extremely strained and is highly unlikely to form.  The reaction creates only one additional ring.
evalFeedback	6	6	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	6	8	What unimolecular pericyclic reaction do conjugated polyenes undergo?  How many more or fewer rings than the starting material should the product have?
evalFeedback	6	9	The product has the same formula as the starting material.  The new #sigma bond of the new ring is formed at the expense of one #pi bond.
evalFeedback	6	10	When the new #sigma bond forms, the remaining #pi bonds migrate.
evalFeedback	6	11	The C-H bonds remain unchanged in this pericyclic reaction.  A conjugated polyene such as this can undergo what ring-forming unimolecular pericyclic reaction?
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  Electrocyclic ring opening occurs to give the conjugated triene.
evalFeedback	7	2	What would be the correct configuration about the double bonds in the ring?

evalFeedback	7	6	A compound that contains a ring with 2<i>n</i> atoms and (<i>n</i> &ndash; 1) alternating #pi bonds can undergo what unimolecular rearrangement reaction?

evalFeedback	7	8	The preexisting #pi bonds migrate when the new #pi bond is formed.
evalFeedback	7	9	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  A compound that contains a ring with 2<i>n</i> atoms and (<i>n</i> &ndash; 1) alternating #pi bonds can undergo what unimolecular rearrangement reaction?
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  In this oxy-Cope rearrangement, the initial product of the [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement is an enol, which tautomerizes to the ketone.
evalFeedback	8	2	Yes, but you have drawn an enol. To what kind of compound will it rapidly convert?
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	8	5	The number of rings doesn't change.  What pericyclic reaction does a 1,5-diene typically undergo?
evalFeedback	8	6	The product has the same formula as the starting material.  Because there is no change in the number of rings, the number of #pi bonds also remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	7	Not only the #sigma bond migrates, but both #pi bonds do, too.  (Of course, the #pi bond that is not part of the 1,5-diene remains unaffected.)
evalFeedback	8	8	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  What reaction do 1,5-dienes typically undergo?
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  Six-electron electrocyclic ring closure occurs in disrotatory fashion to give the cis product.
evalFeedback	9	2	Under thermal conditions, a six-electron electrocyclic reaction occurs in disrotatory fashion.
evalFeedback	9	3	Please specify the stereochemistry of the product.
evalFeedback	9	4	Your answer is not unreasonable, but a different electrocyclic ring closure would give a much less strained product.
evalFeedback	9	5	What ring-forming pericyclic reaction do conjugated trienes typically undergo?
evalFeedback	9	6	The product has the same formula as the starting material.  The new #sigma bond of the new ring is formed at the expense of one #pi bond.
evalFeedback	9	7	When the new #sigma bond forms, the remaining #pi bonds migrate.
evalFeedback	9	8	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  The Claisen rearrangement consists of a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement followed by tautomerization to the phenol.
evalFeedback	10	2	Yes, but this compound is rapidly converted back to an aromatic compound.
evalFeedback	10	3	Migration of an alkyl group to the 4-position does occur, but a different product predominates.
evalFeedback	10	4	The <i>O</i>-alkyl group does not migrate to the 3-position of the aromatic ring.
evalFeedback	10	5	The reaction does not create a new quaternary center, because it prevents rearomatization of the ring.  To what other position can the allylic group migrate?
evalFeedback	10	6	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	10	8	In this rearrangement reaction, the number of rings doesn't change.  Counting from the alkene #pi bond, this compound can be considered to be a 1,5-diene.  What kind of unimolecular rearrangement reaction does a 1,5-diene undergo?
evalFeedback	10	9	The product has the same formula as the starting material.
evalFeedback	10	10	That's the starting material.  Counting from the alkene #pi bond, this compound can be considered to be a 1,5-diene.  What unimolecular rearrangement reaction do 1,5-dienes undergo?
evalFeedback	10	11	The migration occurs in such a way that the atom attached to the O is not attached to the aromatic ring in the product. Draw the curved arrows showing the movement of the electrons in the reaction to see properly the connectivity in the product.
evalFeedback	10	12	Almost all of the C-H bonds in the starting material are present in the product.  If you draw a product in which none of the C-H bonds differ and the number of rings isn't different, you'll receive a clue to the final product.

qStmt	2		Show what product would result from the photochemical [6 + 2] cycloaddition of (3<i>Z</i>)-1,3,5-hexatriene with maleic anhydride.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  A cyclooctadiene ring is formed.  Because this eight-electron reaction occurs under photochemical conditions, the stereochemistry of the starting materials is preserved in the product, so the ring junction is cis.

evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The endo isomer is the one with the H atoms at the ring fusion and the O bridge pointing in the same direction.
evalFeedback	3	2	You've drawn the exo isomer.
evalFeedback	3	3	Because the two H atoms on the maleimide C=C #pi bond are cis, they must remain cis in the product.

evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  The exo isomer is the one with the H atoms at the ring fusion and the O bridge pointing in opposite directions.
evalFeedback	4	2	You've drawn the endo isomer.
evalFeedback	4	3	Because the two H atoms on the maleimide C=C #pi bond are cis, they must remain cis in the product.

Topic: Pericyclic reactions; Set: Yet more pericyclic reactions
qStmt	1		Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Excellent! This reaction is a [4 + 2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction).  The two H atoms at the ring fusion are cis in the dienophile, so they are cis in the product, and the CH2 bridge in the diene is on the inside of the curve of the diene at both termini, so the two C-CH2 bonds point in the same direction.  The endo isomer is obtained preferentially, so the H atoms at the ring fusion and the bridging CH2 group are cis.
evalFeedback	1	2	You have drawn the exo isomer, which is not the predominant product.  What should be the relative configuration of the H atoms at the ring fusion and the bridging CH2 group in the major, endo product?
evalFeedback	1	3	The H atoms at the ring junction are cis in the starting material, so what must be their relative configuration in the product?
evalFeedback	1	4	The two bridgehead H atoms are both on the convex face of the "curve" of the diene in the starting material, so what must be their relative configuration in the product?

qStmt	2		Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	2	1	Fabulous!  Two electrocyclic ring openings gives the E,Z,Z,E tetraene, and an electrocyclic ring closure gives this nice, stable six-membered ring.  The three electrocyclic openings proceed in disrotatory (six electrons), conrotatory (four electrons), and disrotatory (six electrons) fashion, respectively.
evalFeedback	2	2	You've drawn the first intermediate correctly, but this compound undergoes further electrocyclic reactions.
evalFeedback	2	3	You've drawn the second intermediate correctly, but this compound undergoes one more electrocyclic reaction.
evalFeedback	2	4	You're very close, but the stereochemistry is incorrect.  A six-electron ring closure is disrotatory.  When the two groups on the termini of the triene are in and out (Z and E), what will be the ring stereochemistry after ring closure?
evalFeedback	2	5	You're very close, but the stereochemistry is incorrect.  An eight-electron ring opening is conrotatory.  When the two Me groups on the intermediate cyclooctatriene are trans, what will be the preferred stereochemistry of the terminal double bonds in the tetraene product?

evalFeedback	2	7	The configurations of the methyl substituents in the starting material are retained in the product.
evalFeedback	2	8	Please indicate the relative configuration of the methyl groups.
evalFeedback	2	9	Although your answer is not unreasonable, it is much more likely that the two CH3 groups will both rotate outward, not inward.
evalFeedback	2	10	An eight-electron electrocyclic ring opening is conrotatory, so two groups that are trans will end up both out or both in.
evalFeedback	2	11	The two innermost #pi bonds must have the Z stereochemistry because the compound retains the shape of the eight-membered ring.
evalFeedback	2	12	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	2	16	This compound could in principle be obtained from two electrocyclic ring openings followed by an electrocyclic ring closing, but it is unlikely to be a major product.

evalFeedback	4	1	Excellent! This thermal six-electron electrocyclic ring-opening reaction proceeds in disrotatory fashion.  One group on the triene termini is on the convex face of the curve of the triene and the other is on the concave face, so they are trans in the product.

header			Draw the lowest energy alternative resonance structure for this compound.  
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  The lone pair on C is shared with the neighboring C, and the pair of electrons in the C=O #pi bond becomes a lone pair on O.
evalFeedback	1	2	No, that structure is identical to the given one.
evalFeedback	1	3	The total charge on your resonance structure must equal the total charge on the given structure.
evalFeedback	1	4	The two resonance structures should have the same number of atoms of each type.
evalFeedback	1	5	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.
evalFeedback	1	6	This resonance structure is very high in energy because it has three adjacent charged atoms.  The C^+-O^- resonance structure of C=O is not the best answer when there is a negative charge on the C adjacent to the C=O group.
evalFeedback	1	7	The structure you drew is indeed a resonance structure of the given structure, but you can draw a much better resonance structure, one in which every atom has its octet.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The negative charge belongs on the more electronegative element.
evalFeedback	2	2	That's the same as the given structure.
evalFeedback	2	3	The total charge on your resonance structure should equal the total charge on the given structure.
evalFeedback	2	4	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.
evalFeedback	2	5	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.
evalFeedback	2	6	The central N is pentavalent.  The period 2 elements (B, C, N, O, F) cannot have more than an octet of electrons around them.
evalFeedback	2	7	The structure you drew is indeed a resonance structure of the given structure, but you can draw a much better resonance structure, one in which every atom has its octet.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  All carbonyl compounds have this important resonance structure, which shows the reactivity of the C=O group.
evalFeedback	3	2	That's the starting structure.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw a single structure.
evalFeedback	3	4	The total charge on your resonance structure must equal the total charge on the given structure.
evalFeedback	3	5	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.
evalFeedback	3	6	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.
evalFeedback	3	7	This is a proper resonance structure, but the O atom has only seven electrons.  O is very electronegative, so it does not like to lack an octet.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	3	8	The structure you drew is indeed a resonance structure of the given structure, but you can draw a much better resonance structure.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  The next best resonance structure is the one where all atoms still have their octet.
evalFeedback	4	2	This resonance structure is not unreasonable, but there's one that's much better.  (Hint: Draw in all the lone pairs.)

evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The second-best resonance structure has an electron-deficient C and a neutral N with its full octet.
evalFeedback	5	2	The total charge on your resonance structure must equal the total charge on the given structure.
evalFeedback	5	3	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.
evalFeedback	5	4	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.
evalFeedback	5	5	That's the same as the starting structure.
evalFeedback	5	6	No way is the electronegative N going to accept a charge of 2+ and a sextet of electrons.  Which direction are the electrons in the N=C #pi bond of the starting structure more likely to move, toward C or toward N?
evalFeedback	5	7	You have drawn a resonance structure, but the electron-deficiency of N makes this structure not very good.
evalFeedback	5	8	The structure you drew is indeed a resonance structure of the given structure, but you can draw a much better resonance structure.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  O can share a lone pair with B to satisfy its octet.
evalFeedback	6	2	The total charge on your resonance structure must equal the total charge on the starting structure.
evalFeedback	6	3	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.
evalFeedback	6	4	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.

evalFeedback	7	4	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.
evalFeedback	7	5	Your structure is the same as the given structure.
evalFeedback	7	6	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.  The structure you drew is indeed a resonance structure of the given structure, but you can draw a much better resonance structure.
qStmt	8		<P>There is more than one correct answer for this problem.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  A ring #pi bond moves to be exo to the ring, and the positive charge moves to one of three ring C atoms.
evalFeedback	8	2	The total charge on your structure must equal the total charge on the starting material.
evalFeedback	8	3	The formulas of the two structures should be identical.
evalFeedback	8	4	None of the #sigma bonds (atom-to-atom connections) in the starting structure should be different in the product.
evalFeedback	8	5	That's the starting structure.

All atoms have their octet, and the most electronegative atom has the negative charge.

evalFeedback	14	6	No #sigma bonds (including bonds to H) should be formed or broken in drawing a new resonance structure.

qStmt	15		N2O (<i>Hint</i>: N2O has two major resonance contributors.  Draw the better one.)

The C atom with the empty orbital (cation) uses it to form a #pi bond with the neighboring C atom by moving the 2 #pi electrons. The cation moves to the next C atom and forms a new secondary carbocation.

evalFeedback	11	1	Good! There are two correct responses. The unshared electron moves to form a bond to the neighboring alkene C. One electron from the C=C bond completes the bond to the east, and the other moves to become an unshared electron to the west.

evalFeedback	11	9	The compound on the right is not a resonance structure of the compound on the left, and the electron-flow arrows you've drawn do not lead to this compound.

evalFeedback	13	13	Right!  The lone pair on C is shared with the neighboring C, and the pair of electrons in the C=C #pi bond slides over one bond, and the pair of electrons in the C=O #pi bond becomes a lone pair on O, which acquires a negative charge.  All atoms have their octet, and the most electronegative atom has the negative charge.

Although it is not at all obvious, the CH2-CH2 group on one side of the ring is not in exactly the same environment as the CH2-CH2 group on the other side of the ring, so each stereogenic C atom is indeed attached to four different groups.
evalFeedback	11	3	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	11	4	A C atom of a CH3 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	11	5	Is there any C atom in this compound that, when you switch the two groups attached to it, generates a stereoisomer of the compound?
evalFeedback	11	6	Is there any other C atom in this compound that, when you switch the two groups attached to it, generates a stereoisomer of the compound?
evalFeedback	11	7	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	12	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	12	2	Good!  The C atom bearing the NH2 group is attached to four different groups, so it is stereogenic.
evalFeedback	12	3	Is there any C atom in this compound that is attached to four different groups?  Look at the groups all the way out to their ends.
evalFeedback	12	4	The N atom of an NH2 group is never stereogenic.  In general, trivalent N(sp3) is not stereogenic on the human time scale.
evalFeedback	12	5	The C atoms of CH2 and CH3 groups are never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	12	6	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	13	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	13	2	Good!  Both tertiary C atoms are stereogenic, because switching the CH2 and H groups attached to either one converts the compound from trans to cis.  Although it is not at all obvious, the CH2 group on one side of each tertiary C atom is not in exactly the same environment as the CH2 group on the other side of the same atom, so each stereogenic C atom is indeed attached to four different groups.
evalFeedback	13	3	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	13	4	An H atom is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	13	5	Is there any C atom in this compound that, when you switch two groups attached to it, generates a stereoisomer of the compound?
evalFeedback	13	6	Is there any other C atom in this compound that, when you switch two groups attached to it, generates a stereoisomer of the compound?
evalFeedback	13	7	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	14	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	14	2	Good!  Only the C atom attached to the nicotine ring is stereogenic, because only it is attached to four different groups.  The N in the five-membered ring is not considered stereogenic because it can invert rapidly.
evalFeedback	14	3	Although the N in the five-membered ring is tetrahedral and has four different groups (including a lone pair) pointed to the four corners of space, it is not considered stereogenic because it inverts rapidly.
evalFeedback	14	4	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	14	5	The C atom of a CH3 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	14	6	Are any atoms in this compound attached to four different groups?
evalFeedback	14	7	Don't label any sp2-hybridized atoms.
evalFeedback	14	8	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	15	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	15	2	Good!  Both the C atom attached to the pyridine ring and the N atom in the five-membered ring are stereogenic.  The ring N atom is attached to four different groups, and it lacks a lone pair, so it cannot invert.
evalFeedback	15	3	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	15	4	The C atom of a CH3 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	15	5	Are any atoms in this compound attached to four different groups?
evalFeedback	15	6	Does the N in the five-membered ring have four different groups attached, and does it lack a lone pair?  If so, then it is stereogenic.
evalFeedback	15	7	Don't label any sp2-hybridized atoms.
evalFeedback	15	8	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	16	1	Please draw and label the requested compound.
evalFeedback	16	2	Good!  The four atoms of the tetrahydrofuran ring are stereogenic.  The P is not stereogenic because the P=O bond is better written as P^+-O^-, and in this resonance form, it is clear that the P has two identical groups attached.
evalFeedback	16	3	The P atom is not stereogenic.  The P=O bond is better written as a P^+-O^- bond.  When written that way, it is clear that two of the four groups attached to P are identical.
evalFeedback	16	4	Trivalent N undergoes rapid lone pair inversion, so it is usually not stereogenic.  In any case, the N atom attached to the O-containing ring is sp2-hybridized because its lone pair is used in resonance.
evalFeedback	16	5	The C atom of a CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	16	6	None of the N and O atoms is stereogenic, nor are any of the C(sp2) atoms.
evalFeedback	16	7	You've labelled at least one stereocenter properly (on the central ring), but more remain to be labelled.
evalFeedback	17	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	17	2	Excellent!  Both P atoms are stereogenic.  One is attached to four different groups.  The other is attached to three different groups, but it is still tetrahedral, with its lone pair occupying the fourth corner of the tetrahedron.  Inversion of the P atom is very slow, unlike N inversion, so the trivalent P atom is stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	3	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	4	A C atom of a CH3 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	5	An O atom is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	6	Are any sp3-hybridized atoms in this compound attached to four different groups?  Hint: Not just C atoms can be stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	7	A N atom that is attached to three different groups and has a lone pair is not considered stereogenic, because it can undergo rapid lone pair inversion.  However, heavier elements such as P, S, and Se undergo lone pair inversion only very slowly.  So what other atom in this compound is stereogenic?
evalFeedback	17	8	None of the C atoms of the Ph rings are stereogenic.
evalFeedback	17	9	Please label atoms only with map number 1.
evalFeedback	18	1	Please draw and label the given compound.
evalFeedback	18	2	Excellent!  The S atom is attached to three different groups, but it is still tetrahedral, because it has a lone pair occupying the fourth corner of the tetrahedron.  (The S=O bond is better written as an S^+-O^- bond.  It is not at all like a C=O bond.)  Inversion of the S atom is very slow, unlike N inversion, so the trivalent S atom is stereogenic.  There is also a stereogenic C atom.
evalFeedback	18	3	The C atom of any CH2 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	18	4	A C atom of a CH3 group is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	18	5	An O atom is never stereogenic.
evalFeedback	18	6	Are any sp3-hybridized atoms in this compound attached to four different groups?
evalFeedback	18	7	The S=O bond is not at all like a C=O bond, because the S atom bears a lone pair.  A N atom that is attached to three different groups and has a lone pair is not considered stereogenic, because it can undergo rapid lone pair inversion.  However, heavier elements such as P, S, and Se undergo lone pair inversion only very slowly.  So what other atom in this compound is stereogenic?
evalFeedback	18	8	None of the C atoms of the Ph ring are stereogenic.
evalFeedback	18	9	Please label atoms only with map number 1.

qStmt	1		Draw the enantiomer of the following structure.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct!  In the enantiomer, the stereocenter has the opposite configuration.
evalFeedback	1	2	Enantiomers are isomers, so they must have the same formula.
evalFeedback	1	3	Enantiomers have identical atom-to-atom connections.

evalFeedback	3	1	Correct!  All the stereocenters have opposite configurations.
evalFeedback	3	2	Enantiomers are isomers, so they must have the same formula.
evalFeedback	3	3	Enantiomers have identical atom-to-atom connections.

evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  This compound has three stereocenters, but symmetry causes it to have only four stereoisomers. Two (the ones that are 1,3-cis) are achiral, and two (the ones that are 1,3-trans) are enantiomers of each other. In the two 1,3-trans compounds, C^2 is not stereoegenic, so it doesn't matter what kind of bond from C^2 to the Me group you use.

Topic: Stereochemistry; Set: Draw an isomer or stereoisomer
qStmt	1		Draw a skeletal isomer of <i>trans</i>-3-hexene.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  A correct answer has the same formula as trans-3-hexene but different atom-to-atom connections.
evalFeedback	1	2	That's <i>trans</i>-3-hexene itself, not a skeletal isomer of it.
evalFeedback	1	3	The structure you have drawn is a stereoisomer of <i>trans</i>-3-hexene, not a skeletal isomer of it.
evalFeedback	1	4	A skeletal isomer of <i>trans</i>-3-hexene must have the same molecular formula as <i>trans</i>-3-hexene.  What is the formula of <i>trans</i>-3-hexene?

evalFeedback	5	2	That's the starting structure itself, not a skeletal isomer of it.
evalFeedback	5	3	The structure you have drawn is a stereoisomer of the starting structure, not a skeletal isomer of it, because it has all the same atom-to-atom connections of the starting structure.

qStmt	6		Draw a configurational diastereomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  The configurational diastereomer has the same atom-to-atom connections, but different internal dimensions.  Cis and trans isomers are stereoisomers.
evalFeedback	6	2	That's the starting structure itself, not a configurational diastereomer of it.
evalFeedback	6	3	That's the configurational enantiomer of the given structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A diastereomer has different internal dimensions from the reference compound and is not a mirror image of it.

evalFeedback	6	5	The starting structure and its configurational diastereomer must have the same molecular formula.
evalFeedback	6	6	Your answer is a skeletal isomer of the starting structure, not a configurational diastereomer of it.  A reference compound and its configurational diastereomer have the same atom-to-atom connections.

evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  A reference compound and its configurational enantiomer are nonsuperimposable mirror images, with identical internal dimensions.
evalFeedback	7	2	That's the starting structure itself, not a configurational diastereomer of it.
evalFeedback	7	3	That's the configurational diastereomer of the given structure, not the enantiomer of it.  Enantiomers have the same different internal dimensions and are nonsuperimposable mirror images.

qStmt	8		Draw a configurational stereoisomer of (<i>R</i>)-lactic acid.  Lactic acid has the formula CH3CH(OH)CO2H.  It is also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good.  You drew (<i>S</i>)-lactic acid, the configurational stereoisomer of (<i>R</i>)-lactic acid.
evalFeedback	8	2	That's (<i>R</i>)-lactic acid itself, not its configurational stereoisomer.
evalFeedback	8	3	You must show the configuration at the stereocenter.
evalFeedback	8	4	A stereoisomer of (<i>R</i>)-lactic acid must have the same formula and the same atom-to-atom connections as (<i>R</i>)-lactic acid itself.
evalFeedback	8	5	That's not the structure of lactic acid.  The correct structure is given in the instructions.
qStmt	9		Draw a diastereomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  The diastereomer differs at one, but not all, stereocenters.
evalFeedback	9	2	That's the starting structure itself, not a diastereomer of it.
evalFeedback	9	3	That's the enantiomer of the given structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A diastereomer differs at some but not all of the stereocenters.
evalFeedback	9	4	You must show the configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	9	5	The starting structure and its diastereomer must have the same molecular formula.
evalFeedback	9	6	Your answer is a skeletal isomer of the starting structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A reference compound and its diastereomer have the same atom-to-atom connections.
qStmt	10		Draw the enantiomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  The enantiomer differs at all stereocenters from the reference compound.
evalFeedback	10	2	That's the starting structure itself, not its enantiomer.
evalFeedback	10	3	That's a diastereomer of the given structure, not its enantiomer.  Enantiomers differ at all of their stereocenters.
evalFeedback	10	4	You must show the configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	10	5	The starting structure and its diastereomer must have the same molecular formula.
evalFeedback	10	6	Your answer is a skeletal isomer of the starting structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A reference compound and its diastereomer have the same atom-to-atom connections.
qStmt	11		Draw a configurational stereoisomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  Altering the configuration of one of the stereocenters gives a stereoisomer (the diastereomer).  However, because the starting compound is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry), altering the configuration of both stereocenters doesn't give the enantiomer; it just gives back the starting structure.
evalFeedback	11	2	That's the same as the starting structure.  If you altered the configuration of both stereocenters, that process generates the enantiomer of a starting structure that is chiral.  In this case, though, the starting structure is achiral, so altering the configuration of both stereocenters gives back the starting structure!
evalFeedback	11	3	You must show the configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	11	4	Stereoisomers do not differ in their atom-to-atom connections.
qStmt	12		Draw the enantiomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	12	1	Right!  Enantiomers differ in their configurations at all of their stereocenters.
evalFeedback	12	2	That's the same as the starting structure.
evalFeedback	12	3	You have drawn a diastereomer of the given structure.
evalFeedback	12	4	Please specify the stereochemistry more carefully.
evalFeedback	12	5	The starting structure and its enantiomer must have the same molecular formula.
evalFeedback	12	6	The enantiomer must have the same atom-to-atom connections.
qStmt	13		Draw a diastereomer of the compound shown.
evalFeedback	13	1	Right!  The diastereomer differs in the double bond stereochemistry; the C(sp3) stereochemistry is irrelevant.
evalFeedback	13	2	That's the starting structure itself, not a diastereomer of it.
evalFeedback	13	3	That's the enantiomer of the given structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A diastereomer differs in the configurations at some but not all of the C(sp3) stereocenters or in the configurations of one or more alkenes.
evalFeedback	13	4	You must show the configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	13	5	Please specify the double-bond configuration.
evalFeedback	13	6	The starting structure and its diastereomer must have the same molecular formula.
evalFeedback	13	7	Your answer is a skeletal isomer of the starting structure, not a diastereomer of it.  A reference compound and its diastereomer have the same atom-to-atom connections.
qStmt	14		Draw the enantiomers of propylene oxide (shown).
evalFeedback	14	1	Bravo!
evalFeedback	14	2	A compound can have no more than two enantiomers.
evalFeedback	14	3	You're almost right. You are asked to draw all enantiomers for propylene oxide.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please specify the configuration of every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	14	5	How many C atoms does "prop" indicate?
evalFeedback	14	6	Despite its name, propylene oxide does not contain an alkene.  Propylene oxide is the compound derived from reaction of propylene (IUPAC name, propene) with an epoxidizing agent.  The reaction with the epoxidizing agent consumes the alkene's #pi bond.
evalFeedback	14	7	What functional group is found in propylene oxide?
qStmt	15		Draw an achiral stereoisomer of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  This isomer is achiral. Although it has two stereogenic centers it is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. It is a meso compound.
evalFeedback	15	2	This isomer is chiral.
evalFeedback	15	3	Please indicate the configuration at both stereocenters.
evalFeedback	15	4	What does "cyclo" indicate?
evalFeedback	15	5	What does "cyclohexane" signify?
evalFeedback	15	6	What does "dimethyl" signify?
evalFeedback	15	7	The structure that you drew is a skeletal isomer, not a stereoisomer, of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.
qStmt	16		Draw a chiral stereoisomer of 1,2-dibromocyclobutane.  Any bold or hashed bonds to Br should not be aligned with either ring bond; instead, they should form an obtuse angle with both ring bonds.
evalFeedback	16	1	Right!  This isomer is chiral. It has two stereogenic centers and no plane of symmetry.
evalFeedback	16	2	This isomer is achiral. It has two stereogenic centers but also a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral.
evalFeedback	16	3	Please indicate the configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	16	4	What does "cyclo" signify?
evalFeedback	16	5	What does "cyclobutane" signify?
evalFeedback	16	6	What does "dibromo" signify about the groups attached to the ring?
evalFeedback	16	7	The structure that you drew is a skeletal isomer, not a stereoisomer, of 1,2-dibromocyclobutane.

evalFeedback	2	2	You included the 1,2-diol with one bold wedge and one hashed wedge in the list, but it is actually achiral.  In the conformation shown, it has a center of symmetry.  Rotate about the central C&ndash;C bond to make one of the C&ndash;CH3 bonds vertical, and you will have a conformation in which there is a plane of symmetry.
evalFeedback	2	3	You included the five-carbon alcohol among your answers.  This compound has no stereocenters, so it is achiral in at least one conformation.
evalFeedback	2	4	You included the cis epoxide among your answers.  It has a plane of symmetry (vertical and perpendicular to the plane of the screen), so it is achiral.

evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The trans-1,2- and trans-1,3-compounds are chiral in all of their conformations.  Among the achiral compounds, only the cis-1,2-compound is chiral in its chair conformation.  The other three compounds have planes of symmetry in their chair conformations.
evalFeedback	3	2	You included the cis-1,3-compound among your answers.  It has a plane of symmetry in its lowest-energy chair conformation.  Both NH2 groups are equatorial, and the plane of symmetry contains C(2) and C(4).
evalFeedback	3	3	You included the trans-1,4-compound among your answers.  It has a plane of symmetry in its lowest-energy chair conformation, so this conformation is achiral.  The plane of symmetry passes through C(1), C(4), and the two N atoms.
evalFeedback	3	4	You included the cis-1,4-compound among your answers.  It has a plane of symmetry in its lowest-energy chair conformation, so this conformation is achiral.  The plane of symmetry passes through C(1), C(4), and the two N atoms.

evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  All of the compounds you chose have a plane of symmetry in at least one conformation.  All of the ones you rejected lack a plane of symmetry in every conformation.
evalFeedback	4	2	You included the monoalcohol among your answers, but it has a single stereocenter, so it must be chiral.
evalFeedback	4	3	You included the 1,2-diol with the two OH groups pointing in opposite directions  among your answers.  This compound has no plane of symmetry in any conformation, so it is chiral.  Another way of looking at it: Its two stereocenters are both R, and a mirror plane cannot relate them, nor is there a mirror plane that contains them both.
evalFeedback	4	4	You included the up-up-down triol among your answers.  It does not have a plane of symmetry in any conformation (its 2nd and 4th stereocenters are both R), so it is chiral.

qStmt	5		Undergraduate research assistant Sally Humdinger makes a sample of <small>L</small>-erythrose by asymmetric synthesis.  Using chiral chromatography, she finds that the ratio of enantiomers in her sample is 4:1.  According to the literature, natural, enantiopure <small>D</small>-erythrose, whose structure is shown in the Figure, has [#a] = &ndash;30&deg;.  What specific rotation can Sally predict she will observe for her sample?
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  A sample with an enantiomeric ratio (er) of 4:1 has an enantiomeric excess (ee) of (4 &ndash; 1) / (4 + 1) = 60%.  Sally's sample will rotate light to 60% of the extent of an enantiomerically pure sample.  Because the D enantiomer is levorotatory (negative optical rotation), and Sally has made the L enantiomer, Sally's sample will be dextrorotatory (positive optical rotation).
evalFeedback	5	2	Sally's sample is L, and the reported rotation is of the D enantiomer.  What should be the sign of rotation?
evalFeedback	5	3	The observed rotation of enantiomerically pure material is 30&deg;.  Sally's sample is less than enantiomerically pure.  How can it have a greater rotation than the enantiopure material?
evalFeedback	5	4	Convert the enantiomeric ratio (er) into an enantiomeric excess (ee) before you multiply the optical rotation of the enantiopure material by this value.
qStmt	6		Sally makes a sample of enantiomerically enriched arabinose and measures its optical rotation as [#a]<sub>observed</sub> = +100&#176;.  She Googles the optical rotation of <small>D</small>-arabinose (see Figure) and finds that it has [#a]<sub>observed</sub> = &ndash;120&#176;.

qdText	6	6	2S,3R,4S
qdText	6	7	2S,3S,4R
qdText	6	8	2S,3S,4S
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  <small>D</small>-Arabinose is levorotatory, and Sally's sample is dextrorotatory, so the majority of Sally's sample is the enantiomer of <small>D</small>-arabinose.  <small>D</small>-Arabinose has the 2S,3R,4R configuration, and its enantiomer must have the opposite configuration at every stereocenter.
evalFeedback	6	2	<small>D</small>-Arabinose itself has this configuration.  Sally's sample rotates plane-polarized light in the opposite direction from <small>D</small>-arabinose.
evalFeedback	6	3	No, try again.  (<b>Note</b>: C(2) of arabinose is the C atom adjacent to the carbonyl C atom.)

evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  <small>L</small>-Isoleucine has the 2S,3S configuration, so Sally's sample is a configurational diastereomer, and the optical rotation of one compound cannot be used to predict the rotation of anything but its enantiomer.
evalFeedback	7	2	Do Sally's sample and <small>L</small>-Isoleucine have identical configurations at all stereocenters?

evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  <small>L</small>-Isoleucine has the 2S,3S configuration, so Sally's sample, which has the opposite configuration at all stereocenters, is a configurational enantiomer.  <small>L</small>-Isoleucine is dextrorotatory, so Sally's sample of <small>D</small>-isoleucine must be levorotatory.

evalFeedback	1	1	Excellent!  When the substrate undergoes this reaction, no bonds to the stereogenic C atom are broken, so its configuration remains unchanged.  The change in the direction of the optical rotation is irrelevant.

evalFeedback	2	1	Excellent!  This product does not have a plane of symmetry, so it is chiral, and given that the starting material was enantiomerically pure, and that the stereocenter was unaffected by the reaction, this product is also enantiomerically pure.
evalFeedback	2	2	This compound has a plane of symmetry, so it is optically inactive.

evalFeedback	3	1	Excellent!  This product has a plane of symmetry, so it is optically inactive.
evalFeedback	3	2	This compound does not have a plane of symmetry, so it is chiral.  Because the starting material was enantiomerically pure, and the stereocenter in the starting material was unaffected by the reaction, the product must also be enantiomerically pure, so it is optically active.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please indicate the stereochemistry of the asymmetric C atoms.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	3	6	There is no alkene in the final product.

qStmt	4		Draw the product of the following reaction.  Show the relative stereochemistry if the product has two or more stereocenters.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  Addition of H2 across the double bond generates only one stereocenter, and the compound is assumed to be racemic, so you don't need to indicate the stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	1	3	You have not indicated the configuration of the stereocenter unambiguously.

Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Predicting SN vs. E
header			Draw the <B>major organic product</b> of the reaction.  Follow this procedure: determine whether the reaction conditions are acidic or basic; identify the most nucleophilic/basic atom, the electrophilic atom, and the leaving group; predict whether elimination or substitution will occur; and then draw the product.  Indicate the stereochemistry at every stereocenter with a single wedged (up), hashed (down), or wavy (a mixture of up and down; either) bond.   
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  These are basic conditions (note the S-K bond).  S is a good nucleophile / poor base, and the alkyl halide is primary. An SN2 reaction occurs.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	1	4	Br is a leaving group.  It should not be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	5	The K^+ ion is not incorporated into the organic product of this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	6	EtOH is merely a solvent in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	7	A S atom would be introduced by a substitution reaction.  An alkene would be introduced by an elimination reaction.  You can't have both an alkene and a S atom in your product.
evalFeedback	1	8	The S atom in thiolates such as PhSK is a great nucleophile and a poor base, so elimination is disfavored relative to another reaction.
evalFeedback	1	9	Elements below the first row of the main group, like S, are usually excellent nucleophiles and poor bases, so S should be incorporated into your product.
evalFeedback	1	10	The benzene ring attached to S remains unchanged in the reaction, and it remains attached to S.
evalFeedback	1	11	The phenyl ring, including its H atoms, remains unchanged in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	12	C-C and C-H bonds are unlikely to be made or broken in this reaction.  The organic portion of the alkyl bromide starting material is incorporated into the product unchanged.
qStmt	2		DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) is a polar aprotic solvent.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct!  These are basic conditions (note the presence of K).  F is a good nucleophile and a good base, but the electrophile is a primary alkyl halide, so SN2 occurs.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw a single, neutral organic product.
evalFeedback	2	3	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	4	The solvent is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	5	The K-F bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give K^+ and F^-. The K^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	2	6	Would this reaction change the number of C atoms in the substrate?
evalFeedback	2	7	This substrate cannot undergo an elimination reaction: there is no H-C-C-Br group.  A nucleophile must therefore be incorporated into the product.  What component of the mixture is most likely to react as a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	2	8	There is only one leaving group in the starting material, so only one F should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	9	The product retains the benzene ring (including the three #pi bonds) of the starting material.
evalFeedback	2	10	No C-C or C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  These are "stealth" acidic conditions--the alkyl halide really wants to ionize to form a very low energy, Lewis acidic carbocation.  With a nucleophilic solvent like EtOH, SN1 occurs.
evalFeedback	3	2	Under acidic conditions in a protic solvent such as EtOH, it is highly likely that an alkyl halide will react with the solvent to give the substitution product, not the elimination product.
evalFeedback	3	3	Yes, the C-Br bond is replaced with a C-O bond, but the O must come from EtOH.  Which of the two bonds to O is more likely to break when the O in EtOH makes a new bond?
evalFeedback	3	4	The product should be drawn in its neutral form, in which O has only two bonds. Which bond to O is broken after the C-O bond is formed?
evalFeedback	3	5	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	3	6	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	3	7	Br is a leaving group, so it is not part of the product.
evalFeedback	3	8	The product retains the benzene ring (including the three #pi bonds) of the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	9	No C-C or C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	3	10	There is only one leaving group, so only one equivalent of the nucleophile (EtOH) is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	11	Look at the most reactive portions of each starting material.  Which atoms are most likely to make a bond to one another?
evalFeedback	3	12	Count your C atoms carefully.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  The conditions are thoroughly neutral, but a great nucleophile (S) is combined with a great electrophile (CH3I), so SN2 occurs.
evalFeedback	4	2	When S makes three bonds, what should its formal charge be?
evalFeedback	4	3	Ether is a solvent; it does not participate in the reaction.
evalFeedback	4	4	The substrate is Me2S.  Shouldn't your product contain S?  What is the reactive atom in Me2S, and is it nucleophilic or electrophilic?
evalFeedback	4	5	I is a great leaving group.  It ends up unattached to anything.
evalFeedback	4	6	The leaving group is I.  CH3I can't undergo elimination, so it has to undergo substitution.  The leaving group doesn't contain C, so the total number of C atoms in the product must equal the number of C atoms in the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	7	The C atoms of Me2S are unreactive under these neutral conditions.
evalFeedback	4	8	No, that's not right.  Hint: the product is a salt.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  These are "stealth" acidic conditions--the alkyl halide really wants to ionize to form a very low energy, Lewis acidic carbocation.  With a nonnucleophilic solvent, E1 occurs.
evalFeedback	5	2	Benzene is unlikely to participate in this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	5	5	Cl is a leaving group in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	6	There's no nucleophile present (benzene is only a solvent), so substitution can't occur.  An elimination reaction introduces a new C=C bond.
evalFeedback	5	7	The product retains the benzene ring (including its three #pi bonds) of the starting material.
evalFeedback	5	8	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	5	9	One of the C atoms of the new double bond should be the one formerly attached to Cl.
evalFeedback	5	10	The product should have only one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  E^2 elimination occurs to give the alkene.
evalFeedback	6	2	Yes, that is one of the products, but it's not the one we're looking for.
evalFeedback	6	3	The expected organic product is neutral.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	6	5	With all the steric bulk around the N atom in the reagent above the arrow, do you think N will be incorporated into the product?
evalFeedback	6	6	The N-Li bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give N^- and Li^+. The Li^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	6	7	THF is a solvent; it does not participate in the reaction.
evalFeedback	6	8	Chlorine is a leaving group, so it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	9	It is unlikely that C-C bonds would be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	6	10	If LiN(iPr)2 is not acting as a nucleophile, what reaction must it be promoting, and what functional group must be present in the product?
evalFeedback	6	11	The product of an elimination reaction has exactly one more C=C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  These are basic conditions (note the O-Na bond).  The EtONa is a good base and a good nucleophile, but the primary alkyl halide much prefers to undergo substitution.
evalFeedback	7	2	Do 1&#176; alkyl halides prefer to undergo substitution or elimination?
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	4	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	7	5	The O-Na bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give O^- and Na^+ . The Na^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	7	6	Br is a leaving group, so it is not part of the product.
evalFeedback	7	7	Would EtO^- be acting as a base or a nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	7	8	It is unlikely that C-C bonds would form or break during this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	7	9	If O is incorporated into the product, wouldn't the group attached to O also be incorporated?
evalFeedback	7	10	It is unlikely that C-C or C-H bonds would form or break during this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	11	No, try again.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  The higher energy diastereomer, the non-Zaitsev product, is obtained predominantly because of the requirement for antiperiplanar elimination (H-C-C-Br 180 degree dihedral angle).
evalFeedback	8	2	Close, but the requirement for an antiperiplanar arrangement for E^2 elimination means that the other alkene diastereomer will be obtained.
evalFeedback	8	3	This compound is only a minor product of the reaction.  Zaitsev's rule says which alkene regioisomer should be obtained predominantly?
evalFeedback	8	4	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	8	5	MeO^- is unlikely to act as a nucleophile toward a tertiary alkyl halide, so O is not going to be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	8	6	Br is a leaving group.  It is unlikely to be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	8	7	If MeO^- is not acting as a nucleophile, what reaction must it be promoting, and what functional group must be present in the product?
evalFeedback	8	8	No C-C bonds are likely to be formed or broken in this reaction, and the benzene rings (including their #pi bonds) remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	9	The product should have exactly one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	9	1	Correct!  The reactive C loses its configurational purity (it racemizes).
evalFeedback	9	2	Would this reaction under acidic conditions be SN1 or SN2?  What happens to the stereochemistry at the reactive C?
evalFeedback	9	3	Please specify the configuration of the stereocenter.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) to indicate a mixture of configurations.
evalFeedback	9	4	In a protic solvent like CH3OH, a secondary alkyl halide is much more likely to undergo substitution than elimination.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a single molecule as your product.
evalFeedback	9	6	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	9	7	Br is a leaving group.  It is unlikely to be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	8	When the solvent is water or an alcohol and the conditions are acidic, the solvent is likely to act as a nucleophile and be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	9	The benzene ring of the starting material (and its three #pi bonds) remains intact in the product.
evalFeedback	9	10	No C-C bonds are likely to be formed or cleaved in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	9	11	Yes, the O of the solvent is incorporated into the product, but the C-O bond in the solvent should be preserved.
evalFeedback	9	12	The number of C atoms in the product equals the sum of C atoms in the alkyl halide and in CH3OH.
evalFeedback	9	13	To which C atom should the O of the solvent attach itself?
qStmt	10		(D is deuterium, ^2H.)
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  Inversion occurs upon SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	10	2	No, that is the product of retention of configuration. This is an SN2 reaction (basic conditions, primary alkyl halide), so inversion occurs cleanly.
evalFeedback	10	3	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Racemization often occurs in substitution reactions under acidic conditions, but these conditions are basic.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) to indicate a mixture of configurations at any one stereocenter.
evalFeedback	10	5	The number of D atoms does not change in this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	6	The D atom is attached to the electrophilic C in the starting material.  It should be attached to that same C in the product.
evalFeedback	10	7	The C of the ^-CN ion is less happy about having a lone pair, so it makes the bond to the electrophilic C atom.
evalFeedback	10	8	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	10	10	The NC-Na bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give NC^- and Na^+. The Na^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	10	11	Cl is a leaving group in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	10	12	EtOH is a solvent; it does not participate in the reaction.
evalFeedback	10	13	Primary alkyl halides such as this one tend to undergo substitution, not elimination.  (The isotopic substitution of D for H does not change the steric environment of the electrophilic C atom.)
evalFeedback	10	14	If ^-CN is not acting as a base to promote elimination, what is its role in this reaction?  What reaction must it be promoting?
evalFeedback	10	15	Count your carbons carefully.  The number of C atoms in the product equals the sum of C atoms in the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	10	16	The C-H and C-D bonds of the starting material remain intact in the product.
evalFeedback	10	17	The C#tripleN bond in NaCN is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  Under these acidic conditions, Zaitsev's rule says that the alcohol will eliminate in the direction that gives the lowest energy product, in this case the E isomer of the trisubstituted alkene.
evalFeedback	11	2	Close.  Zaitsev's rule says which stereoisomer of the alkene should be obtained predominantly?
evalFeedback	11	3	That is the right idea, but for full credit, indicate the proper double-bond stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	11	4	This compound is only a minor product of the reaction. Zaitsev's rule says which alkene regioisomer should be obtained predominantly?
evalFeedback	11	5	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	11	6	Under acidic conditions, and especially for tertiary alcohols such as this one, OH is a leaving group.  O is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	11	7	It is unlikely that C-C bonds would form or break during this reaction, which generates a tertiary carbocation.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	11	8	Benzene is merely a solvent in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	11	9	Benzene is not a good nucleophile.  No other nucleophile is present, so what reaction must be occurring?  And what functional group is always obtained in this reaction?
evalFeedback	11	10	In an elimination reaction, the elements of HX are lost (X is the leaving group), and the product has one additional #pi bond.
evalFeedback	11	11	In an elimination reaction, the C atom to which the leaving group was attached in the starting material participates in the new #pi bond.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  Under strong acidic conditions and in the presence of a good, nonbasic nucleophile, primary alcohols undergo SN2 reactions.  Both OH groups react.
evalFeedback	12	2	Primary alcohols do not undergo elimination reactions under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	12	3	Why would only one of the OH groups react?
evalFeedback	12	4	Your answer is very imaginative, but it is not correct.  The Br^- in the reaction mixture is a far more powerful nucleophile than the OH group elsewhere in the molecule.
evalFeedback	12	5	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	12	6	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	12	7	Under acidic conditions, OH is a leaving group, so it is not part of the product.
evalFeedback	12	8	No C-C or C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	12	9	What atom is most likely to act as a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	12	10	Both leaving groups are replaced with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	13	1	Correct!  BuLi, a very strong base, deprotonates the alkyne, and the resulting C^- nucleophile displaces Br to make a new C-C bond.
evalFeedback	13	2	Please draw a single, neutral organic product.
evalFeedback	13	3	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	4	Li acts merely as a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	13	5	BuLi acts merely as a base.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	6	All of the C-C bonds of the nucleophile and the electrophile are preserved unchanged in the product, and only one C-H bond (from the enyne) is not preserved.  Which C atom in the enyne is most acidic?
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  The N in the five-membered ring replaces the Cl atom attached to the six-membered ring, and the N-K bond is cleaved.  The product is commonly known as thalidomide.
evalFeedback	14	2	An elimination is not an unreasonable answer, but the two carbonyl groups render the N atom of the nucleophile so nonbasic that it much prefers to do substitution than to promote elimination.
evalFeedback	14	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	14	5	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	14	6	K is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	14	7	The only change in the electrophile is that the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-nucleophile bond.
evalFeedback	14	8	The only change in the nucleophile is that the N-K bond is replaced with an N-electrophile bond.
evalFeedback	15	1	Good!  Under "stealth acidic" conditions such as these, Zaitsev's rule always applies, so the lower energy isomer is obtained.
evalFeedback	15	2	What would Zaitsev tell you about the stereochemistry of the product?
evalFeedback	15	3	This compound is only a minor product of the reaction.  Zaitsev's rule says which alkene regioisomer should be obtained predominantly?
evalFeedback	15	4	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	15	5	Br is a leaving group.  It is unlikely to be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	15	6	There is no nucleophile present, so what reaction is occurring, and what functional group must be present in the product?
evalFeedback	15	7	No C-C bonds are likely to be formed or broken in this reaction, and the benzene rings (including their #pi bonds) remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	15	8	The product should have exactly one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  When the electrophile is a tertiary alcohol and the solvent is a carboxylic acid, SN1 substitution occurs.
evalFeedback	16	2	Although this substrate could undergo an E1 elimination, what other reaction takes place when the solvent is a carboxylic acid?
evalFeedback	16	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	16	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	16	5	What happens to the OH group of a tertiary alcohol under acidic conditions such as these?
evalFeedback	16	6	What compound, and which atom in that compound, acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	16	7	The formula of the substitution product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials, minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	16	8	The OAc group should be attached to the same C as bore the leaving group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!  When the electrophile is a tertiary alcohol, the solvent is a poor nucleophile, and the reaction conditions are acidic, E1 elimination occurs.
evalFeedback	17	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	17	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	17	4	What happens to the OH group of a tertiary alcohol under acidic conditions such as these?
evalFeedback	17	5	What functional group is obtained from a tertiary alcohol under acidic conditions in the absence of any nucleophile?
evalFeedback	17	6	The formula of the elimination product equals the formula of the starting material, minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	17	7	The new double bond should involve the C atom previously attached to the OH group.
evalFeedback	18	1	Good!  When the electrophile is a tertiary alcohol, the conditions are acidic, and a good nucleophile is present, SN1 substitution occurs.
evalFeedback	18	2	Although this substrate could undergo an E1 elimination, what other reaction takes place when a good nucleophile such as Cl^- is present?
evalFeedback	18	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	18	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	18	5	What happens to the OH group of a tertiary alcohol under acidic conditions such as these?
evalFeedback	18	6	What compound, and which atom in that compound, acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	18	7	The formula of the substitution product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials, minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	18	8	The Cl atom should be attached to the same C as bore the leaving group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	19	1	Good!  When the electrophile is a secondary alcohol that can form a very low-energy carbocation upon loss of ^-OH, the conditions are acidic, and the solvent is an alcohol, SN1 substitution occurs.
evalFeedback	19	2	Although this substrate could undergo an E1 elimination, what other reaction takes place when the solvent is a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	19	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	19	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	19	5	The TsOH is used only catalytically, so it can't be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	19	6	The ring in the starting material remains intact.
evalFeedback	19	7	What happens to the OH group of a hemiacetal under acidic conditions?
evalFeedback	19	8	What compound, and which atom in that compound, acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	19	9	The formula of the substitution product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials, minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	19	10	The O atom of the OCH3 group should be attached to the same C as bore the leaving group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	20	1	Good!  The nucleophilic Br^- opens the epoxide in Markovnikov fashion under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	20	2	Which C of the epoxide is the Br^- more likely to attack under acidic conditions?  Think Markovnikov's rule.
evalFeedback	20	3	Although this substrate could undergo an E1 elimination, what other reaction is more likely to place when a good nucleophile such as Br^- is present?
evalFeedback	20	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	20	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	20	6	What happens to an epoxide under acidic conditions such as these in the presence of a good nucleophile such as Br^-?
evalFeedback	20	7	What compound, and which atom in that compound, acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	20	8	What functional group is always obtained when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile?
evalFeedback	20	9	Because the leaving group is tethered to the starting material, the formula of the substitution product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	20	10	One of the C-O bonds should not break, and the Br should be attached to the other C formerly of the epoxide.
evalFeedback	21	1	Good! When a 2&#176; alkyl halide reacts with a compound that is both a good base and a good nucleophile, the predominant product is usually elimination.
evalFeedback	21	2	What would Zaitsev say about the predominant stereochemistry o the double bond produced by elimination?
evalFeedback	21	3	Please specify the double bond's stereochemistry in the major isomer.
evalFeedback	21	4	The EtONa is a good base and a good nucleophile; what is its major behavior when it reacts with 2&#176; alkyl halides?
evalFeedback	21	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	21	6	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	21	7	The O-Na bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give O^- and Na^+ . The Na^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	21	8	Br is a leaving group, so it is not part of the product.
evalFeedback	21	9	EtO^- is a good nucleophile and a good base. What is its primary mode of reaction when it encounters a 2&#176; alkyl halide? EtOH is just a solvent; it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	21	10	If EtONa is not acting as a nucleophile, it must be promoting what reaction?  And what functional group is always obtained in this reaction?
evalFeedback	21	11	It is unlikely that C-C bonds would form or break during this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	21	12	Where along the chain must the double bond be located in the product?
evalFeedback	22	1	Good!  I^- is both an excellent nucleophile and an excellent leaving group.  SN2 displacement of I^- with I^- causes the electrophilic center to racemize.  The other stereocenter remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	22	2	Your answer is perfectly reasonable, but it's not correct.  I^- is both an excellent leaving group and an excellent nucleophile.  What would be the effect on the configuration of the electrophilic stereocenter of I^- displacing I^- a random number of times?
evalFeedback	22	3	Under these weakly basic conditions (note the presence of the metal Na), the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	22	4	Stereocenters that are not electrophilic are unaffected under these conditions.
evalFeedback	22	5	Please specify the stereochemistry at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	22	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	22	7	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	22	8	Na is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	22	9	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	22	10	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	22	11	Acetone is merely a solvent.  Its elements are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	22	12	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	22	13	The only change in the electrophile is that the bond between C and the leaving group is replaced with a bond between C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	22	14	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.  (Acetone is the solvent, not a starting material.)
qStmt	23		pyr = pyridine (a base)
evalFeedback	23	1	Right!  In step 1, TsCl converts OH into a better leaving group without affecting the C-O bond.  In step 2, ^-CN displaces ^-OTs, forming a C-C bond at the expense of the C-O bond and inverting the stereochemistry of the electrophilic C to give a trans disubstituted product.
evalFeedback	23	2	NaCN has a sufficiently low basicity (pKa of HCN = 9) that it gives predominantly substitution with 2&#176; alkyl halides and pseudohalides.
evalFeedback	23	3	Close. What is the stereochemical course of a substitution reaction?
evalFeedback	23	4	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under acidic conditions, loss of configurational purity at the electrophilic C atom may be expected, but the substitution reaction here occurs under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	23	5	Please specify the stereochemistry at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	23	6	The C atom in ^-CN is more nucleophilic (less happy about bearing a lone pair) than the N atom, so the C atom makes the new bond.
evalFeedback	23	7	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	23	8	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	23	9	The purpose of the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is to convert OH into a better leaving group. The organic product contains no remnant of this reagent.
evalFeedback	23	10	The purpose of the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is to convert the OH into a better leaving group so that the second reagent can replace it.
evalFeedback	23	11	The number of rings in the product equals the number of rings in the starting material.  Pyridine is just a base; it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	23	12	No C-C bonds are broken in this reaction, and the only new C-C bond is between the OH-bearing C of the starting material and ^-CN of the reagent.
evalFeedback	24	1	Right!  The stereochemistry at the electrophilic C atom inverts under these basic, SN2 conditions.
evalFeedback	24	2	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	24	3	The stereochemistry of the Ph group is unaffected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	24	4	Please specify the configuration at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	24	5	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	24	6	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	24	7	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	24	8	The PhS-K bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give PhS^- and K^+. The K^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	24	9	You are being asked to draw the substitution product, not the elimination product.
evalFeedback	24	10	PhS^- is a great nucleophile, and it should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	24	11	The Ph-S bond in the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	24	12	The atom in the nucleophile that makes the bond to the electrophile is the atom that has a lone pair.
evalFeedback	24	13	C-C bonds are unlikely to form or break in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	24	14	In a substitution reaction, the C that has the leaving group in the starting material is attached to the nucleophilic atom in the product.

evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  The major substitution product has undergone inversion of configuration at the electrophilic C in this SN2 reaction under basic conditions.  (In fact, elimination will predominate over substitution under these conditions.)
evalFeedback	1	2	Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	1	3	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Racemization often occurs under acidic conditions, but not under basic conditions.

evalFeedback	1	10	The HO^- replaces the leaving group in a substitution reaction.
evalFeedback	1	11	Draw in all the H atoms near the reactive center, and you will see why your answer is not correct.  C-H bonds are unaffected by a substitution reaction.
evalFeedback	1	12	Rearrangements are unlikely to occur under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	1	13	When HO^- is the nucleophile, what functional group does the product have?
qStmt	2		#heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, SN1 substitution occurs, and the product is a mixture of stereoisomers.
evalFeedback	2	2	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Look at the reaction conditions.  What would be the mechanism of substitution, and what would be the expected stereochemical result?
evalFeedback	2	3	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.

evalFeedback	2	7	C-C bonds are not likely to form or break in this reaction.  Count your C atoms.
evalFeedback	2	8	Although a substantial amount of elimination product would be obtained in this reaction, you are being asked to draw the substitution product.
evalFeedback	2	9	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile is incorporated into the product.  In this reaction, the nucleophile is H2O.
evalFeedback	2	10	Draw in all the H atoms around the reactive center, and you will see why your answer is incorrect.  C-H bonds are unaffected by a substitution reaction.
evalFeedback	2	11	Assume that a rearrangement does not occur.
evalFeedback	2	12	What functional group is obtained when H2O is the nucleophile?
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Only the electrophilic stereocenter inverts.  The one that is not involved in the reaction remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	3	2	Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	3	3	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under basic conditions such as these, loss of configurational purity at the electrophilic C atom is unlikely to be observed.
evalFeedback	3	4	The stereochemistry of the Me group is unaffected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	3	5	Please specify the stereochemistry at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.

evalFeedback	3	7	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	3	8	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	9	Although the elimination product would predominate under these conditions, you are being asked to draw the substitution product.
evalFeedback	3	10	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	11	The nucleophilic atom--the one that makes the new bond to the electrophile--is the atom that bears a lone pair.
evalFeedback	3	12	The O-C bond of the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	3	13	C-C bonds are unlikely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.

evalFeedback	4	4	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Under acidic conditions and in the presence of a large excess of H2O or an alcohol, tertiary alkyl halides undergo substitution, not elimination.
evalFeedback	4	6	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile replaces the leaving group.
evalFeedback	4	7	What functional group should be obtained when H2O is the nucleophile in a substitution reaction?
evalFeedback	4	8	C-C bonds are unlikely to form or break under these conditions.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	4	9	Tertiary alkyl halides don't tend to rearrange, so the OH group in the product should be in the same place where the leaving group was in the starting material.
qStmt	5		#heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  A C-O bond replaces the C-Br bond, and the O-H bond cleaves, too.

evalFeedback	5	4	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	5	6	The benzene ring does not participate directly in the reaction.
evalFeedback	5	7	The atom in the nucleophile that makes the new bond to the electrophile is the atom that bears the lone pair.
evalFeedback	5	8	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	5	9	When an alcohol acts as a nucleophile in a substitution reaction, the O-H bond of the alcohol, not the C-O bond, will be cleaved in the product.
evalFeedback	5	10	Please count your carbons carefully.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  A C-P bond replaces the C-Cl bond, and the P atom increases its formal charge by one.
evalFeedback	6	2	Close, but you are missing a formal charge. How many bonds does P have, and how many does it normally have?
evalFeedback	6	3	Close, but the formal charge on P is incorrect.
evalFeedback	6	4	The Cl acts as a leaving group in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	5	The nucleophilic atom is the one bearing a lone pair, and it should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	6	The P-Ph bonds are very strong, and none cleave in the course of this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	7	The C-C and C-H bonds of the group attached to Cl in the starting material remain unchanged in the product.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The stereochemistry at the electrophilic C atom inverts under these basic, SN2 conditions.
evalFeedback	7	2	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	7	3	The stereochemistry of the Ph group is unaffected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please specify the configuration at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	7	5	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	7	6	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	7	7	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	7	8	The PhS-K bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give PhS^- and K^+. The K^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	7	9	You are being asked to draw the substitution product, not the elimination product.
evalFeedback	7	10	PhS^- is a great nucleophile, and it should be incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	7	14	In a substitution reaction, the C that has the leaving group in the starting material is attached to the nucleophilic atom in the product.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  Alkenyl bromides are not usually reactive toward nucleophiles; the C(sp2)-Br bond is too strong, and backside displacement is much more sterically encumbered.  In the substitution product, then, the C(sp3)-Br bond is replaced with a C(sp3)-O bond, but the C(sp2)-Br bond remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	2	Only a single product is obtained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	3	The C(sp2)-Br bond is generally unreactive toward nucleophiles.
evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	5	The Br attached to C(sp3) is a leaving group.  It should not be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	8	6	PhO^- is a very good nucleophile, so the product should contain O.
evalFeedback	8	7	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	8	8	You are being asked to draw a substitution product, not an elimination product.
evalFeedback	8	9	No C-H bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	8	10	What functional group is obtained when an alkoxide reacts with an alkyl halide?
evalFeedback	8	11	The Ph-O bond remains intact when PhO^- reacts with the electrophile.
evalFeedback	8	12	The alkenyl bromide portion of the molecule remains unchanged; C(sp2)-Br is not susceptible to SN1 or SN2 substitution.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  Under these "stealth acidic," SN1 conditions, the stereocenter's configuration is scrambled.
evalFeedback	9	2	Would this substrate undergo SN1 or SN2 substitution under these conditions?  How many products would be obtained?
evalFeedback	9	3	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	9	6	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	7	The benzene ring of the starting material (including its three #pi bonds) remains intact.
evalFeedback	9	8	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken during this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	9	9	In a substitution reaction, no #pi bonds are made or broken.
evalFeedback	9	10	What do you think the H2O will do after the Cl leaves?
evalFeedback	9	11	The O should be attached to the same C to which the Cl was attached.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  This substrate must undergo SN1 substitution, and the stereocenter racemizes.
evalFeedback	10	2	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under these conditions, what mechanism of substitution is likely to occur, and what is likely to be the stereochemical result?
evalFeedback	10	3	Please specify the stereochemistry at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.
evalFeedback	10	4	After the nucleophilic atom in CH3OH makes a new bond to the electrophile, only the H-O bond breaks.  The O-C bond in the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	10	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	7	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	8	What is the nucleophilic atom?  It should be incorporated into the product.

evalFeedback	10	10	The benzene ring of the starting material (including its three #pi bonds) remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	10	11	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or cleaved.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	10	12	Elimination is unlikely to occur with all that CH3OH around.
evalFeedback	10	13	What is the nucleophilic atom?  It should make a bond to the electrophilic C.
evalFeedback	10	14	The O should be attached to the same C to which the Cl was attached.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  The stereochemistry at the stereocenter doesn't change, because it isn't a reactive center.
evalFeedback	11	2	The stereochemistry of the CH3 group is unaffected by the reaction. Inversion in SN2 reactions occurs only at the reactive center.
evalFeedback	11	3	The stereochemistry of the Me group remains unchanged.

Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: More sophisticated substitution an..
header			Give the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  The MsCl turns the OH into a better leaving group, and CH3CO2^- is a good nucleophile.
evalFeedback	1	2	The purpose of the MsCl is to convert the OH into a better leaving group. The organic product contains no remnant of this reagent.
evalFeedback	1	3	Et3N is merely a base.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	1	4	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	1	5	It is unlikely that C-C bonds would be made or cleaved in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	1	6	In this substitution reaction, the O in the organic starting material is *replaced* by the nucleophile, so the organic product should have no more than two O atoms.
evalFeedback	1	7	The second reagent, CH3CO2^-, is incorporated into the organic product, so your answer should have at least two O atoms.
evalFeedback	1	8	The second reagent, CH3CO2^-, contains a carbonyl group, and this reagent is incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  PBr3 converts alcohols to alkyl bromides by a mechanism involving two SN2 reactions.
evalFeedback	2	2	The PBr3 converts the OH into a better leaving group, so the ultimate product contains no P.
evalFeedback	2	3	Pyridine acts only as a base in this reaction, so the product should not contain N.
evalFeedback	2	4	The O-P bond is very strong, so the P takes the O away from the C, replacing it with what?
evalFeedback	2	5	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	2	6	No C-C bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons, please.
evalFeedback	2	7	This primary alcohol is unlikely to give an elimination product (the alkene).
evalFeedback	2	8	The nucleophile in this reaction is generated when O of the starting material reacts with PBr3.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles, one of the C-O bonds of the epoxide cleaves, and that C makes a new bond to the nucleophile.  Under acidic conditions, the more substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide ring forms the bond with the nucleophile.  When an alcohol acts as a nucleophile, the O-H bond is cleaved in the product.
evalFeedback	3	2	Under acidic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at the C best able to bear a positive charge.
evalFeedback	3	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	3	4	The ring in the starting material is very strained.  It pops open upon reaction with the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	3	5	No C-C bonds will be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	3	6	The nucleophile will be incorporated into the product, and the leaving group will remain in the product, too, because it is attached to the substrate through <i>two</i> bonds.
evalFeedback	3	7	The O of the epoxide is not the electrophilic atom.  The electrophilic atom is <i>attached</i> to the leaving group.
evalFeedback	3	8	The O of the nucleophile should make a bond to the electrophilic atom.  Which atom is that?  (Hint: It is NOT the O of the epoxide!)
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  In step 1, TsCl converts the OH into the better leaving group OTs.  In step 2, the C-OTs bond is replaced by a C-OPh bond in an SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	4	2	The purpose of the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is to convert the OH into a better leaving group. The organic product contains no remnant of this reagent.
evalFeedback	4	3	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	4	4	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	4	5	A primary alkyl tosylate will undergo substitution, not elimination, when presented with this nucleophile.
evalFeedback	4	6	The O of the nucleophile is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	7	The Ph of the nucleophile is also incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	8	The O of the PhO^- makes the bond to the electrophilic atom.
evalFeedback	4	9	The O of the nucleophile replaces the O of the electrophile.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  When epoxides react with nucleophiles, one of the C-O bonds of the epoxide cleaves, and that C makes a new bond to the nucleophile.  Under basic conditions, the less substituted of the two C atoms of the epoxide ring forms the bond with the nucleophile.  The O atom of the nucleophile increases its formal charge by 1 when it makes the new bond.
evalFeedback	5	2	Under basic conditions, epoxides react with nucleophiles at the least hindered C.
evalFeedback	5	3	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	5	4	The epoxide ring is opened up by the nucleophile, so the product doesn't contain a ring.
evalFeedback	5	5	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	5	6	Epoxides are much more prone to undergo substitution than elimination.
evalFeedback	5	7	The nucleophile is incorporated into the product.  The leaving group (the O of the epoxide) is connected by two bonds to the starting material, so it is also present in the product.
evalFeedback	5	8	The O of the epoxide is not an electrophilic atom, so the nucleophile doesn't make a bond to it.  The O of the epoxide is <i>attached</i> to the electrophilic atoms.
evalFeedback	5	9	The O of the nucleophile makes a bond to the electrophilic atom in the starting material.  (Hint: The electrophilic atom is <i>not</i> the O of the epoxide.)
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  SOCl2 converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides by a mechanism involving two SN2 reactions.
evalFeedback	6	2	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	6	3	The S of SOCl2 makes the OH group into a better leaving group, so the organic product contains no S.
evalFeedback	6	4	Pyridine acts as a base in this reaction. It does not participate otherwise.
evalFeedback	6	5	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	6	6	The purpose of the reaction is to convert the OH into a different group.
evalFeedback	6	7	The nucleophile in this reaction is generated when the O of the starting material reacts with SOCl2.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The C-Mg bond is polarized toward the more electronegative C atom.  Think of PhCH2MgBr as PhCH2^- MgBr^+.  The nucleophilic C attacks the electrophilic C of the epoxide to make a new C-C bond at the expense of one of the C-O bonds.  The O gains a H atom upon workup.
evalFeedback	7	2	Please draw the neutral product that is obtained after workup.
evalFeedback	7	3	After workup, the MgBr group in the organic product is replaced with H, so there is no Mg or Br in the organic product.
evalFeedback	7	4	The starting material has seven C atoms and ethylene oxide has two, so how many C atoms should the product have?
evalFeedback	7	5	The nucleophilic atom in the Grignard reagent is the one attached to Mg.  The electrophilic atom in the epoxide is the one attached to the leaving group.  The leaving group in an electrophile is usually the most electronegative atom.
evalFeedback	7	6	The product when nucleophiles react with epoxides is an alcohol, because the C-O bond breaks.
evalFeedback	7	7	Draw out the epoxide starting material, along with all C-H bonds in both starting materials, before drawing the product.  No C-H bonds will be made or broken.
qStmt	8		#heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  Secondary alcohols tend to rearrange to tertiary carbocations under strongly acidic conditions, and the most substituted product that can result from this intermediate is obtained.
evalFeedback	8	2	You are on the right track. However, the intermediate secondary carbocation is likely to rearrange to a more stable carbocation before it loses a proton to give the alkene.
evalFeedback	8	3	You are on the right track. However, after carbocation rearrangement, another alkene that is lower in energy than the one you drew can form.
evalFeedback	8	4	No C atoms are lost or gained in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	8	5	The H2SO4 acts only as a strong acid in this reaction. The product should not contain S.
evalFeedback	8	6	The purpose of the H2SO4 is to catalyze the dehydration (loss of H2O) of the starting material.
evalFeedback	8	7	Strong acids do not oxidize alcohols to ketones.
evalFeedback	8	8	When secondary or tertiary alcohols are treated with strong acid in the absence of a nucleophile, they undergo elimination.
evalFeedback	8	9	After the OH group leaves to give a secondary carbocation, what group can shift to give a more stable tertiary carbocation?  The alkene is derived from loss of H^+ from that intermediate.
qStmt	9		pyr = pyridine (a base)
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  In step 1, TsCl converts OH into a better leaving group without affecting the C-O bond.  In step 2, ^-CN displaces ^-OTs, forming a C-C bond at the expense of the C-O bond and inverting the stereochemistry of the electrophilic C to give a trans disubstituted product.
evalFeedback	9	2	Close. What is the stereochemical course of a substitution reaction?
evalFeedback	9	3	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Under acidic conditions, loss of configurational purity at the electrophilic C atom may be expected, but the substitution reaction here occurs under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please specify the stereochemistry at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	9	5	The C atom in ^-CN is more nucleophilic (less happy about bearing a lone pair) than the N atom, so the C atom makes the new bond.
evalFeedback	9	6	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	9	7	Please draw a single molecule.
evalFeedback	9	8	The purpose of the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is to convert OH into a better leaving group. The organic product contains no remnant of this reagent.
evalFeedback	9	9	The purpose of the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is to convert the OH into a better leaving group so that the second reagent can replace it.
evalFeedback	9	10	The number of rings in the product equals the number of rings in the starting material.  Pyridine is just a base; it is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	11	No C-C bonds are broken in this reaction, and the only new C-C bond is between the OH-bearing C of the starting material and ^-CN of the reagent.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  The C-Cu bond is polarized toward C, so think of Pr2Cu^- Li^+ as being like Pr^-.  The cuprate reagent reacts not only with alkyl halides but also with alkenyl and aryl halides to give substitution products, so the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-Pr bond.
evalFeedback	10	2	A metal is not incorporated into the organic product. The reagent serves as a source of nucleophilic C.
evalFeedback	10	3	The Cl atom is a leaving group in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	4	Only one propyl group from the reagent is incorporated into the product.  The other is "wasted."
evalFeedback	10	5	No C-H bonds are made or broken in the starting material, and the C-C bonds in the starting material remain intact.
evalFeedback	10	6	The starting material has 6 C atoms, and the reagent has two 3-carbon groups (only one of which is used).  Count the carbons in your product.
evalFeedback	10	7	No C-H bonds are made or broken when the Cl is replaced with the CH3CH2CH2 group.
Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Drawing elimination products
header			Draw the major <b>organic elimination</b> product(s) of the reaction.  Indicate double bond stereochemistry by positioning the substituents appropriately.  Do not use hashed or wedged bonds for groups attached to C(sp2)!
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  The major product is the trans isomer of the more substituted alkene.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Some of this product might be obtained, but it would not be the major product.  The major product would be lower in energy.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please specify the stereochemistry about the double bond.
evalFeedback	1	6	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you the alkene with the most substituents.
evalFeedback	1	7	I is a leaving group.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	1	8	K is not incorporated into the organic product.  It pairs up with the leaving group and is discarded as a salt.
evalFeedback	1	9	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	1	10	In an elimination reaction, the base is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	11	C-C bonds are unlikely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	1	12	An elimination reaction always gives a product with one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	1	13	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	1	14	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material and an adjacent C.
qStmt	2		DBU is a nonnucleophilic base.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The lower-energy, trans product predominates.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	2	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	2	4	There is a lower-energy product that will predominate.  Think stereochemistry.

evalFeedback	2	7	I is a leaving group in this reaction.

evalFeedback	2	9	An elimination reaction always gives a product with one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	2	10	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	2	11	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material.
qStmt	3		Under acidic conditions, OH can act as a leaving group.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Elimination of H2O under acidic conditions follows Zaitsev's rule, so the more substituted alkene is obtained, and it has the E geometry.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	3	4	Zaitsev would tell you that the major product is the stereoisomer that is lowest in energy.
evalFeedback	3	5	Please specify the stereochemistry of the double bond.
evalFeedback	3	6	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you the alkene with the most substituents.
evalFeedback	3	7	OH acts as a leaving group, and the acid catalyst is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	8	No C-C bonds will be made or broken in this reaction, and the #pi bonds of the phenyl ring will remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	3	9	An elimination reaction always gives a product with one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	10	The new #pi bond should involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	11	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
qStmt	4		TsCl = toluenesulfonyl chloride; DBU is a nonnucleophilic base.

evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a single, organic product.  (Don't draw the leaving group.)
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you the alkene with the most substituents.
evalFeedback	4	5	In an elimination reaction, no new atoms are incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	6	OH is converted into a leaving group, so it is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	4	7	No C-C bonds are made or broken in the course of this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	4	8	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C-C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	4	9	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	4	10	The C that bore the leaving group in the starting material should be involved in the #pi bond in the product.
qStmt	5		TsCl = toluenesulfonyl chloride; DBU is a nonnucleophilic base.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct!  Zaitsev's rule is superseded by the requirement of E^2 elimination for an anti (trans in a cyclic compound) relationship between the leaving group and the adjacent H.  The more substituted product can't be obtained here because the H that would have to be removed can't be anti to the OH.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please draw a single, organic product.  (Don't draw the leaving group.)
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	5	4	Zaitsev's rule is superseded by the requirement of E^2 elimination for an anti relationship between the H that is removed and the leaving group.  In this cyclic compound, the H that you removed to get this product is cis to the OH, so it can't be anti to it.  Only C(^6) has an H that can be anti to the OH.
evalFeedback	5	5	The configuration of the stereocenter that is not involved in the reaction remains unaltered.
evalFeedback	5	6	In an elimination reaction, no new atoms are incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	7	The OH group is converted into a leaving group by step 1.  It is not preserved in the organic product.
evalFeedback	5	8	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	9	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C-C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	5	10	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	5	11	The C bearing the leaving group in the starting material should be involved in a #pi bond in the product.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The major product is the more substituted one resulting from loss of HCl.
evalFeedback	6	2	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs to give you the alkene with the most substituents possible.
evalFeedback	6	3	The configurations of stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction are preserved.
evalFeedback	6	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	6	5	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	6	6	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	6	7	The MeO group is a terrible leaving group.  There is a much better leaving group in this compound.
evalFeedback	6	8	MeO^- is a base in this reaction, not a nucleophile.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	9	The only bonds that are made or broken in an elimination reaction are the C-leaving group bond and an adjacent C-H bond.
evalFeedback	6	10	The product of an elimination reaction has one more #pi bond than the starting material.  No new atoms are incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	6	11	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	6	12	The new #pi bond in the product should involve the C that was bound to the leaving group in the starting material.
qStmt	7		TsOH is a fairly strong acid.  #heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  The requirement for anti disposition of the H and the leaving group doesn't apply to E1 eliminations such as this one, so Zaitsev's rule applies.
evalFeedback	7	2	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you the most substituted alkene.  Elimination is taking place under acidic conditions, so the mechanism is E1, so there is no requirement for anti disposition of the leaving group and the H that is removed.
evalFeedback	7	3	Zaitsev would tell you that elimination occurs in the direction that gives you a more substituted product.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	A neutral product is expected.
evalFeedback	7	6	OH is the leaving group in this reaction.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	7	7	The TsOH is merely an acidic catalyst.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	7	8	No C-C bonds are expected to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	7	9	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C-C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	7	10	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	7	11	The new #pi bond in the product should involve the C atom that bore the leaving group in the starting material
qStmt	8		LDA is LiN(i-Pr)2, a hindered, nonnucleophilic base.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  H is removed from the stereogenic C adjacent to the C-I bond to expel I^- and form the alkene, but the stereogenic C further removed is unaffected.
evalFeedback	8	2	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	8	4	The configurations of stereocenters not involved in the reaction remain unaltered.

evalFeedback	8	8	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C-C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	8	9	Only one new #pi bond is introduced in the product.
evalFeedback	8	10	The new #pi bond in the product <i>must</i> involve the C that bore the leaving group in the starting material.  <i>Then,</i> if there is a choice of products, you can apply Zaitsev's rule.  In this case, though, there is no choice of products.

evalFeedback	1	1	Correct!  The ^-CN attacks the alkene C that is distal to the leaving group, and the #pi bond migrates over to expel the leaving group.
evalFeedback	1	2	Close, but the major product would have the lower energy configuration about the #pi bond.
evalFeedback	1	3	That's the SN2 product.  The SN2&#180; reaction involves attack on an alkene C and migration of the #pi bond.
evalFeedback	1	4	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	1	5	Na is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	6	The product should contain the CN group.
evalFeedback	1	7	The number of C atoms in the product should be the sum of the C atoms in the starting materials.
evalFeedback	1	8	The product has an alkene group also.
evalFeedback	1	9	In the SN2&#180; reaction, the alkene C atom further from the leaving group acquires the nucleophile, and the #pi bond migrates to between the other alkene C atom and the C atom bearing the leaving group.
qStmt	2		Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  The SN2&#180; product is obtained predominantly because the alkene in this product is more substituted.
evalFeedback	2	2	Your answer is a minor product of this reaction.  The major product has a more substituted C=C bond.  Think SN2&#180;.
evalFeedback	2	3	The C skeleton is unlikely to change.
evalFeedback	2	4	The OH group acts as a leaving group in this reaction.
evalFeedback	2	5	P is not incorporated into the final product.
evalFeedback	2	6	Only one Br atom is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	7	No C-H bonds are made or broken in this reaction.  Obey Grossman's Rule.
evalFeedback	2	8	The product should contain Br.
evalFeedback	2	9	The Br atom should replace the OH group in either SN2 or SN2&#180; fashion.  In the SN2' reaction, the alkene C atom further from the leaving group acquires the nucleophile, and the #pi bond migrates to between the other alkene C atom and the C atom bearing the leaving group.
qStmt	3		Draw the E2&#180; elimination product.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The H atom is removed from a C atom adjacent to the alkene C atom distal from the leaving group.  A new #pi bond is formed, the old #pi bond migrates over toward the C atom bearing the leaving group, and the leaving group leaves.
evalFeedback	3	2	No, that's the E2 elimination product.  In the E2&#180; elimination, the H atom is removed from a C atom adjacent to the alkene C atom distal from the leaving group.  A new #pi bond is formed, the old #pi bond migrates over toward the C atom bearing the leaving group, and the leaving group leaves.
evalFeedback	3	3	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	4	t-BuOK acts only as a base.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	5	The C skeleton should remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	3	6	In an elimination reaction, the product has one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	7	In E2&#180; elimination, the H atom is removed from a C atom adjacent to the alkene C atom distal from the leaving group.  A new #pi bond is formed, the old #pi bond migrates over toward the C atom bearing the leaving group, and the leaving group leaves.
qStmt	4		Draw the major product of the reaction.  (TsOH, you should remember, is a strong acid.)
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  The lower energy E1&#180; elimination product predominates over the higher energy E1 elimination product.
evalFeedback	4	2	Close.  The two alkenes should both be in their lower energy diastereomeric form (both E).
evalFeedback	4	3	You have correctly drawn the E^1 elimination product, but a lower energy elimination product can be obtained.
evalFeedback	4	4	OH is a leaving group under acidic conditions.  The product contains no O.
evalFeedback	4	5	TsOH is a catalyst.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	6	The C skeleton is unlikely to be altered under these conditions.
evalFeedback	4	7	In an elimination reaction, the product has one more #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	4	8	In an E1&#180; elimination reaction, a H atom is removed from a C atom adjacent to the alkene C atom distal from the leaving group.  A new #pi bond is formed, the old #pi bond migrates over toward the C atom bearing the leaving group, and the leaving group leaves.
qStmt	5		Draw the major product of this reaction.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The nucleophile attacks the least hindered electrophilic C atom, which gives the SN2' substitution product.
evalFeedback	5	2	Close, but the lower energy diastereomer of the alkene is obtained predominantly.
evalFeedback	5	3	Your answer is not unreasonable, but attack on a different electrophilic C atom can give a more substituted alkene as the product.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw a neutral product (after aqueous workup).
evalFeedback	5	5	An epoxide is an electrophile.  It reacts with a nucleophile to give an alcohol.
evalFeedback	5	6	The number of C and O atoms in the product should equal the sum of C and O atoms in the starting materials.
evalFeedback	5	7	The C skeleton of neither component is altered, and all of the C-H bonds remain unchanged.
evalFeedback	5	8	The number of #pi bonds does not change in a substitution reaction.
evalFeedback	5	9	One of the epoxide C atoms is also allylic, so the nucleophile can attack the C atom of the alkene distal to the epoxide, pushing the #pi bond over, and cleaving one of the C-O bonds.  After workup, an alcohol is obtained.
qStmt	6		Give the two substitution products (skeletal isomers) when the following compound is added to a solution of sodium acetate in acetic acid.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  Direct substitution of Cl with OAc can occur, or OAc can attach to the C(sp2) distal from the electrophilic C(sp3), shifting the #pi bond concomitantly.
evalFeedback	6	2	You've drawn the direct substitution product correctly, but you're missing the allylic substitution product.
evalFeedback	6	3	The configuration of the double bond is unlikely to change in the direct substitution product.
evalFeedback	6	4	You've drawn the allylic substitution product correctly, but you're missing the direct substitution product.
evalFeedback	6	5	You're asked to draw two products.
evalFeedback	6	6	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	6	7	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	6	8	No C-C #sigma bonds are formed or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	6	9	In a substitution reaction, the number of #pi bonds remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	6	10	Which atom acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?  To which electrophilic atom will it make a bond?
evalFeedback	6	11	What is the structure of acetate?  It is incorporated into each organic product.  Which atom in acetate makes a bond to the electrophilic atom in the substrate?
evalFeedback	6	12	The formula of both products equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials (the alkyl chloride and acetate), minus the elements of the leaving group.
qStmt	7		Give the two substitution products (skeletal isomers) when the following compound is added to a solution of sodium acetate in acetic acid.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!  Direct substitution of Br with OAc can occur, or OAc can attach to the C(sp2) distal from the electrophilic C(sp3), shifting the #pi bond concomitantly.
evalFeedback	7	2	You've drawn the direct substitution product correctly, but you're missing the allylic substitution product.
evalFeedback	7	3	You've drawn the allylic substitution product correctly, but you're missing the direct substitution product.
evalFeedback	7	4	You're asked to draw two products.
evalFeedback	7	5	Please draw an uncharged product.
evalFeedback	7	6	Br is a leaving group.  It is not present in the product.
evalFeedback	7	7	No C-C #sigma bonds are formed or broken in this reaction.
evalFeedback	7	8	In a substitution reaction, the number of #pi bonds doesn't change.
evalFeedback	7	9	Which atom acts as the nucleophile in this reaction?  To which electrophilic atom will it make a bond?
evalFeedback	7	10	What is the structure of acetate?  It is incorporated into each organic product.  Which atom in acetate makes a bond to the electrophilic atom in the substrate?
evalFeedback	7	11	The formula of both products equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials (the alkyl bromide and acetate), minus the elements of the leaving group.
Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Alkyl Halides: SN and E
qStmt	1		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Right!  In the substitution product, the C(sp3)-Br bond is replaced with a C(sp3)-O bond.
evalFeedback	1	2	Only a single product is obtained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	1	4	Sodium is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	1	5	The Cl attached to C(sp3) is a leaving group.  It should not be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	6	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	1	7	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  Its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	1	8	Only one equivalent of the nucleophile is incorporated into the organic product.  (The compound below the arrow is the solvent, not a reactant.)
evalFeedback	1	9	What functional group is obtained when an alkoxide reacts with an alkyl halide?
evalFeedback	1	10	No C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	1	11	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.
qStmt	2		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  The Na^+ ion dissociates from the nucleophile, and the C-Br bond is replaced with a C-C#tripleN bond.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	2	4	The Na-CN bond is ionic, and it dissociates into Na^+ and ^-CN.  The Na atom is not incorporated into the organic product.

evalFeedback	2	6	Acetone is merely a solvent.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	7	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	2	8	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile is incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	9	The nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to H or a metal.  Nothing else in the nucleophile changes.
evalFeedback	2	10	The only change in the electrophile is that the C-Br bond is replaced with a bond between that C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	2	11	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.
evalFeedback	2	12	The nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of the bond to the metal, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	3		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	3	1	Right!  The Na^+ ion dissociates from the nucleophile, and the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-S bond.
evalFeedback	3	2	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	3	4	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	3	5	The CH3S-Na bond is ionic, and it dissociates to give CH3S^- and Na^+. The Na^+ is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	6	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	3	7	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  Its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	3	8	The nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to the metal.  Nothing else in the nucleophile changes.
evalFeedback	3	9	The CH3-S bond in the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	3	10	C-C bonds are unlikely to form or break in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	3	11	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.
evalFeedback	3	12	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of the bond to the metal, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	4		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  Na^+ dissociates from the nucleophile, and the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-I bond.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Na^+ dissociates from the nucleophile.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	5	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	6	What is the nucleophile in this reaction?
evalFeedback	4	7	Acetone is merely a solvent in this reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	4	8	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	4	9	The only change in the electrophile is that the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-nucleophile bond.
evalFeedback	4	10	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.
evalFeedback	4	11	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of the bond to the metal, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	5		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  The nucleophilic N atom displaces I^- from CH3I.  The product can be drawn as a salt, or just the cation can be drawn.
evalFeedback	5	2	When N makes four bonds, what should its formal charge be?
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw the product in its lowest energy resonance form, in which every atom has its octet.
evalFeedback	5	4	I is a leaving group.  The product doesn't contain a C-I bond.
evalFeedback	5	5	In this substitution reaction, because the nucleophilic atom is neutral and bears no H atom or metal, the leaving group remains part of the final, ionic product.  Hence, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	5	6	Which atom is the nucleophilic one?  It gains a bond to the electrophilic atom.
qStmt	6		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction (after workup).
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  The C-Br bond is replaced by a C-N bond.  Neutralization of the product upon workup gives the amine.  In practice, this reaction doesn't work very well, because the product amine is more nucleophilic than the starting NH3, so it tends to overalkylate.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please draw the product after workup.  Charged atoms are made neutral by protonation or deprotonation, and metals are replaced with H.
evalFeedback	6	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	6	4	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	6	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	6	6	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  Its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	6	7	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	6	8	The only change in the electrophile is that the C-Br bond is replaced with a bond between that same C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	6	9	Although overalkylation is likely to occur to some degree, assume that such a large excess of NH3 is used that overalkylation does not occur.
evalFeedback	6	10	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to H, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.
evalFeedback	6	11	In a substitution reaction, the C that has the leaving group in the starting material is attached to the nucleophilic atom in the product.
qStmt	7		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  The base deprotonates O, and the C-Cl bond is replaced by a C-O bond.
evalFeedback	7	2	Although your answer is not unreasonable, the reaction of HO^- with the electrophilic C atom is not as fast as the reaction of another nucleophile already present in the starting material with that same atom.  In this reaction, HO^- acts as a base, not as a nucleophile.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	7	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	7	5	Na is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	7	6	Cl is a leaving group.  It is not part of the product.
evalFeedback	7	7	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	7	8	NaOH is merely a base in this reaction.  The product contains only atoms that are found in the organic starting material.
evalFeedback	7	9	The only changes in the starting material are that the C-Cl bond is replaced with a C-nucleophile bond.
evalFeedback	7	10	Which atom is the nucleophile in this reaction?  It should gain a bond to the electrophilic atom.
evalFeedback	7	11	In this intramolecular substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the formula of the starting material minus the elements of H (removed by the base, NaOH) and the leaving group.
qStmt	8		Draw the major product of the following SN2 reaction.  (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)  DMSO is a polar, aprotic solvent.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  Only the electrophilic stereocenter inverts.  The one that is not involved in the reaction remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	8	2	The mechanism of substitution is SN2.  What is the implication for the configuration at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	8	3	Please specify the configuration at each stereogenic C atom.
evalFeedback	8	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	8	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	8	6	Na is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	8	7	DMSO is only a solvent for the reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	8	8	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	8	9	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	8	10	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  In a substitution reaction, its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	8	11	C-C bonds are unlikely to be made or broken in this reaction.  Count your carbons.
evalFeedback	8	12	Only one equivalent of the nucleophile is incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	8	13	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.  (DMSO is a solvent, not a starting material.)
evalFeedback	8	14	In a substitution reaction, the bond between the leaving group and the C atom to which it is attached is replaced with a bond between the nucleophilic atom and the same C atom.
qStmt	9		Draw the major product of the following E^1 reaction.  #heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, a secondary carbocation forms initially.  It then undergoes a 1,2-methyl shift to give a tertiary carbocation, and loss of H^+ gives the Zaitsev product.
evalFeedback	9	2	This is a minor product.  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, after Br^- leaves, a secondary carbocation is obtained.  What reaction that is characteristic of a secondary carbocation can occur before H^+ is lost to give the alkene?
evalFeedback	9	3	What would Zaitsev say about which C neighboring the intermediate carbocation should lose H^+?
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	9	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	9	6	Br is a leaving group. It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	9	7	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C=C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	9	8	In this elimination reaction, the formula of the product equals the formula of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	9	9	Draw the carbocation that forms after Br^- leaves under these "stealth acidic" conditions?  What can it do to become a lower energy carbocation?
qStmt	10		Draw the major product of the following E^1 reaction.  (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)  #heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  The major alkene regioisomer is the more substituted one (Zaitsev's rule).
evalFeedback	10	2	What would Zaitsev say about which C neighboring the intermediate carbocation should lose H^+?
evalFeedback	10	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	10	5	Br is a leaving group. It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	6	Benzene is merely a solvent in this reaction.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	10	7	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C=C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	10	8	Because the carbocation that is obtained upon loss of Br^- under these "stealth acidic" conditions is already tertiary, a rearrangement does not occur, so no C-C bonds are made or broken in the course of this reaction.
evalFeedback	10	9	In this elimination reaction, the formula of the product equals the formula of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	10	10	The C that bore the leaving group in the starting material should be involved in the #pi bond in the product.
qStmt	11		Draw the major product of the following E^1 reaction. (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)  #heat indicates heat.  DMSO is a polar, aprotic solvent.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  Elimination occurs to give the Zaitsev product.
evalFeedback	11	2	This is a minor product.  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, after Br^- leaves, a secondary carbocation is obtained.  What reaction that is characteristic of a secondary carbocation can occur before H^+ is lost to give the alkene?
evalFeedback	11	3	What would Zaitsev say about which C neighboring the intermediate carbocation should lose H^+?
evalFeedback	11	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	11	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	11	6	DMSO is merely a solvent in this reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	11	7	Br is a leaving group. It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	11	8	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C=C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	11	9	Although the secondary carbocation formed upon departure of Br^- under these "stealth acidic" conditions can undergo a rearrangement reaction, it can reach a low-energy, tertiary carbocation by a 1,2-hydride shift, so no C-C bonds are made or broken.
evalFeedback	11	10	In this elimination reaction, the formula of the product equals the formula of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	11	11	Because the carbocation that is initially obtained under these "stealth acidic" conditions rearranges to a lower-energy, tertiary carbocation by a 1,2-hydride shift, the most substituted C atom in the starting material should be involved in a #pi bond in the product.
qStmt	12		Draw an alkyl bromide that will give <i>only</i> 2,4-diphenyl-2-pentene upon treatment with potassium <i>t</i>-butoxide (a bulky base that promotes E^2 elimination).
evalFeedback	12	1	Right!  Elimination of HBr from this compound could <i>only</i> give you the anticipated product.
evalFeedback	12	2	Please draw a single, organic compound.
evalFeedback	12	3	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	12	4	You're being asked to draw an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	12	5	You should have a monobrominated starting material.
evalFeedback	12	6	This bromide would give you a 1-pentene, not a 2-pentene.
evalFeedback	12	7	Although this bromide leads to the desired product, it will not be a clean reaction. A 1-pentene could be obtained also.
evalFeedback	12	8	No C-C single bonds will be formed or broken during this E2 reaction.
evalFeedback	12	9	The Br atom in the starting material should be attached to a C atom that becomes part of the alkene in the product.
qStmt	13		Draw the major product from elimination of (2<i>S</i>,3<i>S</i>)-2-bromo-3-phenylbutane when treated with sodium methoxide.  You may find it helpful to draw the compound in a sawhorse perspective.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good!  Elimination of HBr from the conformation in which H and Br are anti gives this product.
evalFeedback	13	2	You're on the right track, but pay attention to the stereochemistry of the starting material when predicting the stereochemistry of the product.
evalFeedback	13	3	That's the right idea, but for full credit, indicate the stereochemistry.
evalFeedback	13	4	What would Zaitsev say about which C neighboring the electrophilic one should participate in the new #pi bond?
evalFeedback	13	5	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	13	6	The expected product is neutral.
evalFeedback	13	7	Sodium methoxide acts as a base in this reaction.  Its elements are not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	8	Br is a leaving group. It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	13	9	The product of an elimination reaction has one more C=C #pi bond than the starting material.
evalFeedback	13	10	The benzene ring of the starting material remains unchanged in the product.
evalFeedback	13	11	No C-C bonds are made or broken in this reaction. Count your C atoms.
evalFeedback	13	12	In this elimination reaction, the formula of the product equals the formula of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and H.
evalFeedback	13	13	The C that bore the leaving group in the starting material should be involved in the #pi bond in the product.
qStmt	14		Draw the major product of the following substitution reaction.  (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  The reaction conditions are basic (note the presence of the hard metal Na), so the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  The electrophilic stereocenter inverts in an SN2 reaction.
evalFeedback	14	2	The reaction conditions are basic, so what is the mechanism of substitution?  What happens to the configuration at a stereocenter when this kind of substitution reaction occurs there?
evalFeedback	14	3	Please specify the stereochemistry at the stereogenic C atom.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	14	5	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	14	6	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	14	7	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  In a substitution reaction, its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	14	8	There is a much more powerful nucleophile than water in this reaction.  Water is merely the solvent.
evalFeedback	14	9	The nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to the metal.  Nothing else in the nucleophile changes.
evalFeedback	14	10	The only change in the electrophile under these basic conditions is that the bond between the leaving group and the electrophilic C is replaced with a bond between the electrophilic C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	14	11	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.
evalFeedback	14	12	In a substitution reaction, the bond between the leaving group and the C atom to which it is attached is replaced with a bond between the nucleophilic atom and the same C atom.
qStmt	15		Draw the major product of the following substitution reaction.  (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)
evalFeedback	15	1	Good!  I^- is both an excellent nucleophile and an excellent leaving group.  SN2 displacement of I^- with I^- causes the electrophilic center to racemize.  The other stereocenter remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	15	2	Your answer is perfectly reasonable, but it's not correct.  I^- is both an excellent leaving group and an excellent nucleophile.  What would be the effect on the configuration of the electrophilic stereocenter of I^- displacing I^- a random number of times?
evalFeedback	15	3	Under these weakly basic conditions (note the presence of the metal Na), the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	15	4	Stereocenters that are not electrophilic are unaffected under these conditions.
evalFeedback	15	5	Please specify the stereochemistry at each stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.
evalFeedback	15	6	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	15	7	Please draw a single, organic product.
evalFeedback	15	8	Na is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	15	9	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	15	10	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	15	11	Acetone is merely a solvent.  Its elements are not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	15	12	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	15	13	The only change in the electrophile is that the bond between C and the leaving group is replaced with a bond between C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	15	14	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the metal counterion.  (Acetone is the solvent, not a starting material.)
qStmt	16		Draw the major product of the following substitution reaction.  (Use a wavy bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)  #heat indicates heat.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good!  A tertiary halide in an alcohol solvent in the absence of base will undergo substitution by the SN1 mechanism ("stealth acidic" conditions).  The electrophilic stereocenter racemizes.
evalFeedback	16	2	The electrophile is a tertiary alkyl halide, the solvent is an alcohol, and no base is present.  What is the mechanism of the substitution reaction, and what is the implication for the stereochemistry of the electrophilic C atom?
evalFeedback	16	3	Please indicate the configuration at the stereocenter.  (Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)
evalFeedback	16	4	The O atom is attached to an Et group in the starting material, and that bond is unlikely to cleave.
evalFeedback	16	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	16	6	Please draw a single, organic product.  (Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.)
evalFeedback	16	7	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	16	8	In a substitution reaction, one #sigma bond is exchanged for another #sigma bond.  A #pi bond is not introduced.
evalFeedback	16	9	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  In a substitution reaction, its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	16	10	Which is the nucleophilic atom?  It gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to H.  Nothing else in the nucleophile changes.
evalFeedback	16	11	The only change in the electrophile is that the bond between C and the leaving group is replaced with a bond between C and the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	16	12	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of H (from the nucleophilic atom) and the leaving group.
qStmt	17		Predict the product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	17	1	Right!  The Grignard reagent is nucleophilic at C because of the polarized C-Mg bond.  The nucleophilic C makes a new bond to the electrophilic C (the one that bears the leaving group), and the C-metal and C-leaving group bonds break.
evalFeedback	17	2	The new C-C bond that is formed is between the nucleophilic carbon (attached to Mg) and the electrophilic C (attached to the leaving group).  The same product is obtained even if an SN2' reaction occurs (because the double bond is transposed).
evalFeedback	17	3	Only a single product is obtained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	17	4	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	17	5	Magnesium is merely a counterion.  It is not incorporated into the organic product.
evalFeedback	17	6	The Br attached to C(sp3) is a leaving group, and the Br attached to Mg remains associated with the Mg.  Neither should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	17	7	The cyclohexyl ring remains intact in this reaction.
evalFeedback	17	8	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of the leaving group and the counterion MgBr.
evalFeedback	17	9	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of the bond to the metal, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.
qStmt	18		Draw the major product of the following reaction.
evalFeedback	18	1	Right!  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions (allylic halide that can form a low-energy carbocation, no base, heat) and in the presence of protic solvent, substitution occurs by the SN1 mechanism.  Both the C bearing the leaving group and the distal C of the #pi bond are electrophilic, but attack of the nucleophile at the electrophilic C(sp3) gives a product with a more substituted C=C #pi bond.
evalFeedback	18	2	Only a single product is obtained in this reaction.
evalFeedback	18	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	18	4	The Br attached to C(sp3) is a leaving group.  It should not be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	18	5	Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, a low-energy, allylically stabilized carbocation forms, so a rearrangement is unlikely to occur, and no C-C bonds are likely to be made or broken.
evalFeedback	18	6	When an alkyl halide that can form a low-energy carbocation is heated in a protic solvent such as an alcohol, what reaction is more likely to occur than elimination?
evalFeedback	18	7	Which compound is the nucleophile in this reaction?  In a substitution reaction, its elements should be incorporated into the organic product.

evalFeedback	18	10	In this substitution reaction, the formula of the product equals the sum of the formulas of the starting materials minus the elements of H (from the nucleophilic atom in the solvent) and the leaving group.
evalFeedback	18	11	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophilic atom gains a bond to the electrophilic one at the expense of a bond to H, and the bond between the electrophilic atom and the leaving group breaks.  Nothing else changes.

evalFeedback	1	7	The C-C and C-H skeleton of the target remains unchanged in the two starting materials.
qStmt	2		Draw an alcohol and an alkyl bromide that could be combined to give the ether shown.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  These reagents can be combined under acidic conditions (3&deg; electrophile) to give the target ether.  The other disconnection gives a 1&deg; electrophile, which requires basic conditions, and a very hindered 1st-row nucleophile, which promotes E^2 over SN2.
evalFeedback	2	2	Draw both an alcohol and an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	2	3	What kind of conditions are required for a 1&deg; alkyl bromide to undergo substitution?  Under these conditions, would the nucleophile promote substitution or elimination?  Try another disconnection.

qStmt	3		Draw an alcohol and an alkyl bromide that could be combined to give the ether shown.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  These reagents can be combined under basic conditions to give the target ether.  The other disconnection is not as good because the alkoxide will promote both substitution and elimination of the 2&deg; alkyl halide.
evalFeedback	3	2	Although some of the target ether would be obtained if these reagents were combined under basic conditions, the alkoxide derived from deprotonation of the alcohol would promote as much or more elimination from the 2&deg; alkyl bromide as it would substitution.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	3	3	Draw both an alcohol and an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	3	4	One of your compounds should be an alcohol.
evalFeedback	3	5	One of your compounds should be an alkyl bromide.

evalFeedback	3	7	The C-C and C-H skeleton of the target remains unchanged in the two starting materials.
qStmt	4		Draw an alcohol and an alkyl bromide that could be combined to give the ether shown.
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct! Markovnikov addition of MeO-H across the #pi bond occurs under acidic conditions.
evalFeedback	4	2	Although some of the target ether might be obtained if these reagents were combined under acidic conditions, the 2&#176; alkyl bromide could rearrange, and the 3&#176; alcohol could decide to act as an electrophile as well as a nucleophile.  There is a much better answer.
evalFeedback	4	3	Draw both an alcohol and an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	4	4	One of your compounds should be an alcohol.
evalFeedback	4	5	One of your compounds should be an alkyl bromide.

qStmt	5		Draw two uncharged, metal-free compounds, one containing N and the other Br, that could be combined to give the amine shown.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  These reagents can be combined under basic conditions to give the target amine by two SN2 substitutions.
evalFeedback	5	2	That's a good start, but you're asked to draw two compounds, not one.  What further disconnection can you make?
evalFeedback	5	3	Draw two separate compounds.  One should contain N, the other Br.
evalFeedback	5	4	Please draw uncharged, metal-free starting materials.
evalFeedback	5	5	Nucleophilic substitution reactions require that the electrophilic C atom be sp3-hybridized.  Try a different disconnection.
evalFeedback	5	6	One of your compounds should be an amine.
evalFeedback	5	7	One of your compounds should contain Br.
evalFeedback	5	8	The two starting materials should together contain the same number of C atoms as the target.
evalFeedback	5	9	The C-C and C-H skeleton of the target remains unchanged in the two starting materials.
qStmt	6		An alcohol is converted to its tosylate, then allowed to react with a nucleophile to give the compound shown.  Draw the starting alcohol.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  The target is disconnected at the C-CN bond, and the starting alcohol has the configuration inverted from the target.
evalFeedback	6	2	Draw just the alcohol starting material.
evalFeedback	6	3	If this alcohol is converted to its tosylate and then undergoes SN2 substitution with ^-C#tripleN, what will be the stereochemistry of the product?
evalFeedback	6	4	Please indicate the stereochemistry at both stereocenters.
evalFeedback	6	5	Please draw an alcohol.
evalFeedback	6	6	The best bond to disconnect is the one between C(sp) and C(sp3).  The C(sp3) will bear the OH group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	6	7	The phenyl group is present in the starting alcohol.

evalFeedback	6	9	All of the C-H bonds in the target are present in the starting material.
qStmt	7		Draw a simpler alkyne and an alkyl bromide that could be combined to give the alkyne shown.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  These reagents can be combined under basic conditions to give the target alkyne.  The other disconnection is not as good because the alkynyl anion will promote both substitution and elimination of the 2&#176; alkyl halide.
evalFeedback	7	2	Although some of the target alkyne would be obtained if these reagents were combined under basic conditions, the alkynyl anion would promote as much or more elimination from the 2&#176; alkyl bromide as it would substitution.  There is a better answer.
evalFeedback	7	3	Draw both an alcohol and an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	7	4	One of your compounds should be an alkyne.
evalFeedback	7	5	One of your compounds should be an alkyl bromide.

qStmt	8		An alcohol is converted to its tosylate, then allowed to react with a nucleophile to give the compound shown.  Draw the starting alcohol.

evalFeedback	8	6	The best bond to disconnect is the one between N and C(sp3).  The C(sp3) will bear the OH group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	8	7	The phenyl group is present in the starting alcohol.
evalFeedback	8	8	The best bond to disconnect is the one between N and C(sp3).  The C(sp3) will bear the OH group in the starting material.  How many C atoms will the alcohol have?
evalFeedback	8	9	The C-C and C-H bonds in the target are also present in the starting material.
qStmt	9		An alcohol is converted to its tosylate, then allowed to react with a nucleophile to give the compound shown.  Draw the uncharged, metal-free nucleophile.
evalFeedback	9	1	Right!  The two alkyl groups on the N atom are identical, so both N-C bonds can be disconnected at once.
evalFeedback	9	2	Your answer is correct, but there is a better answer.  The two alkyl groups on the N atom in the target are identical, so what nucleophile even more simple than the one you drew can be used?
evalFeedback	9	3	Draw just the alcohol starting material.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please draw a neutral nucleophile.
evalFeedback	9	5	The nucleophile should contain the heteroatom.
evalFeedback	9	6	When a nucleophile reacts with an electrophile, the configuration in the nucleophile remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	9	7	Please indicate the configuration of the stereocenter.
evalFeedback	9	8	The only bond that is disconnected is the one between the heteroatom and an adjacent C atom.  Other parts of the molecule remain unchanged.
qStmt	10		Draw an alkyl bromide from which elimination would give the alkene shown.
evalFeedback	10	1	Right!  The leaving group is attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene.  If it were attached to the other C atom, two different alkenes could be obtained.
evalFeedback	10	2	Elimination of HBr from this compound could give two different alkenes.
evalFeedback	10	3	Draw just one compound, please.
evalFeedback	10	4	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	10	5	The starting material contains one fewer #pi bond than the target.
evalFeedback	10	6	Please draw an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	10	7	The Br atom in the starting material should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene, and the C-C bonds of the alkene are derived unchanged from the starting material.
evalFeedback	10	8	Add Br to one C of the alkene, add H to the other, and delete the #pi bond.
qStmt	11		Draw an alkyl bromide from which elimination would give the alkene shown.
evalFeedback	11	1	Right!  The leaving group is attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene.  If it were attached to the other C atom, two different alkenes could be obtained.
evalFeedback	11	2	Elimination of HBr from this compound would give the more substituted alkene, not the desired one.
evalFeedback	11	3	Draw just one compound, please.
evalFeedback	11	4	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	11	5	The starting material retains the benzene ring and its three #pi bonds.  Benzene rings are not usually made by elimination reactions.
evalFeedback	11	6	The starting material contains one fewer #pi bond than the target.
evalFeedback	11	7	Please draw an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	11	8	The Br atom in the starting material should be attached to one of the C atoms of the alkene, and the C-C bonds of the alkene are derived unchanged from the starting material.
evalFeedback	11	9	Add Br to one C of the alkene, add H to the other, and delete the #pi bond.
qStmt	12		An alcohol is converted to its tosylate, then allowed to react with a strong, hindered base to give the alkene shown.  Draw the starting alcohol.
evalFeedback	12	1	Right!  The OH and H groups are attached to the C atoms that become the alkene.  Only one diastereomer of the alcohol leads to the stereoisomer of the alkene that is shown.  Because the CH3 groups are cis in the product, they must be gauche in the conformer of the starting material in which the C-H and C-O bonds that break are anti.
evalFeedback	12	2	If this alcohol is converted to its tosylate and then undergoes anti E2 elimination, what will be the stereochemistry of the product?
evalFeedback	12	3	Please indicate the stereochemistry at both stereocenters.
evalFeedback	12	4	Draw just the alcohol starting material.
evalFeedback	12	5	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	12	6	Please draw an alcohol.
evalFeedback	12	7	The starting material has one fewer #pi bond than the target.
evalFeedback	12	8	All of the C-C and C-H bonds in the target are present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	12	9	Add an OH group to one C of the alkene, add H to the other, and delete the #pi bond.
qStmt	13		An alcohol is converted to its tosylate, then allowed to react with a strong, hindered base to give the alkene shown.  Draw the starting alcohol.
evalFeedback	13	1	Right!  The OH and H groups are attached to the C atoms that become the alkene.  The OH must go on C(3) because if it were to go on C(4), elimination toward C(5) would give a more substituted product.  Only one diastereomer of the alcohol leads to the stereoisomer of the alkene that is shown.  That diastereomer is the one in which the <i>t</i>-Bu and <i>i</i>-Pr groups are anti when the H and OH that are removed to give the alkene are anti.
evalFeedback	13	2	If this alcohol is converted to its tosylate and then undergoes anti E2 elimination, what will be the stereochemistry of the product?

evalFeedback	13	6	Please draw a neutral compound.
evalFeedback	13	7	Please draw an alcohol.
evalFeedback	13	8	The starting material has one fewer #pi bond than the target.
evalFeedback	13	9	All of the C-C and C-H bonds in the target are present in the starting material.
evalFeedback	13	10	Add an OH group to one C of the alkene, add H to the other, and delete the #pi bond.
qStmt	14		An alcohol is converted into its mesylate, then allowed to react with a thiol under basic conditions to give the sulfide shown.  Draw the starting alcohol and thiol.
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  The thiol can be combined under basic conditions with the tosylate of the alcohol to give the target sulfide.  The configuration at the alcohol C atom is inverted from the product, whereas the configuration of the thiol is unchanged.  The other disconnection is not quite as good because it requires substitution at a sterically more hindered C atom.
evalFeedback	14	2	Your answer is very good, but not the best answer possible.  Try the disconnection that gives a less hindered electrophilic C atom than the one you drew.
evalFeedback	14	3	Draw both an alcohol and an alkyl bromide.
evalFeedback	14	4	One of your compounds should be an alcohol.
evalFeedback	14	5	One of your compounds should be a thiol.
evalFeedback	14	6	The two starting materials should together contain the same number of C atoms as the target.
evalFeedback	14	7	The C-C and C-H skeleton of the target remains unchanged in the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	14	8	The electrophilic C in the starting material--the one attached to the OH group--should have a configuration inverted from the target compound.
evalFeedback	14	9	None of the stereocenters in the nucleophile should have configurations different from the target compound.
evalFeedback	14	10	The configurations of the Me groups don't change in the reaction that converts starting material to product.
evalFeedback	14	11	Please indicate the configuration of every stereocenter.  (There are four of them.)
qStmt	15		Draw two uncharged and metal-free compounds, one containing N and the other Br, that could be combined to give the amide shown.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  These reagents can be combined under basic conditions to give the target compound by an SN2 substitution.  No other single disconnection can separate the target into two simpler starting materials.
evalFeedback	15	2	Draw two separate compounds.  One should contain N, the other Br.
evalFeedback	15	3	Please draw uncharged, metal-free compounds.
evalFeedback	15	4	There is a much simpler answer.  Which one bond can be disconnected to give you two separate starting materials?
evalFeedback	15	5	One of your compounds should contain N.
evalFeedback	15	6	One of your compounds should contain Br.
evalFeedback	15	7	The two starting materials should together contain the same number of C atoms as the target.
evalFeedback	15	8	The C-C and C-H skeleton of the target remains unchanged in the two starting materials.
evalFeedback	15	9	Disconnect only one bond when you draw the starting materials.
qStmt	16		Draw the alcohol that could be used to make the compound shown by an SN2 substitution reaction of the corresponding tosylate.
evalFeedback	16	1	Right!  The target is disconnected at the C(sp3)-O bond, and the starting alcohol has the configuration inverted from the target.
evalFeedback	16	2	Draw just the alcohol starting material.
evalFeedback	16	3	If this alcohol is converted to its tosylate and then undergoes SN2 substitution with ^-OAc, what will be the configuration of the stereocenter in the product?
evalFeedback	16	4	Please indicate the configuration at the stereocenter.
evalFeedback	16	5	Please draw an alcohol.
evalFeedback	16	6	The best bond to disconnect is the one between O and C(sp3).  The C(sp3) will bear the OH group in the starting material.
evalFeedback	16	7	All of the C-C and C-H bonds in the target (except those in the Ac group) are present in the starting material.

Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Draw more substitution products
header			Draw the major <b>organic substitution</b> product(s) of the reaction.  Indicate the stereochemistry at every stereocenter with a single bold (up), hashed (down), or wavy (a mixture of up and down; either) bond.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good!  The major substitution product has undergone inversion of configuration at the electrophilic C in this SN2 reaction under basic conditions.  (In fact, elimination will predominate over substitution under these conditions.)
evalFeedback	1	2	Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?
evalFeedback	1	3	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Racemization often occurs under acidic conditions, but not under basic conditions.
evalFeedback	1	4	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.
evalFeedback	1	5	Please draw a neutral product.

evalFeedback	1	9	The product does not contain any atoms other than C, H, and O.
evalFeedback	1	10	Although elimination will predominate over substitution under these conditions, you are being asked to draw the substitution product, not the major product.
evalFeedback	1	11	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	1	12	The nucleophilic atom--the one that makes the new bond to the electrophile--is the atom that bears a lone pair.
evalFeedback	1	13	The O-C bond of the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	1	14	In a substitution reaction, the bond between the leaving group and the C atom to which it is attached is replaced with a bond between the nucleophilic atom and the same C atom.
evalFeedback	2	1	Right!  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, SN1 substitution occurs, and the product is a mixture of stereoisomers.
evalFeedback	2	2	The stereochemistry is incorrect.  Look at the reaction conditions.  What would be the mechanism of substitution, and what would be the expected stereochemical result?
evalFeedback	2	3	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atom.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.

evalFeedback	2	10	In a substitution reaction, the nucleophile should be incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	2	11	The nucleophilic atom--the one that makes the new bond to the electrophile--is the atom that bears a lone pair.
evalFeedback	2	12	The O-C bond of the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	2	13	In a substitution reaction, the bond between the leaving group and the C atom to which it is attached is replaced with a bond between the nucleophilic atom and the same C atom.
evalFeedback	3	1	Excellent! The reaction occurs through the SN1 mechanism, and after the first step, when a secondary carbocation is formed, a rearrangement occurs with formation of a more stable tertiary carbocation. MeOH attaches to this electrophilic carbocation.
evalFeedback	3	2	This would be the product if the reaction would go through an SN2 mechanism. But CH3OH is not a very good nucleophile and Cl is a good leaving group. What other type of substitution could take place under these "stealth acidic" conditions?
evalFeedback	3	3	You're close. The reaction indeed goes through an SN1 mechanism. A secondary carbocation is formed after the Cl atom leaves. Can you form through a rearrangement a more stable carbocation?
evalFeedback	3	4	What would be the mechanism of this substitution reaction under these "stealth acidic" conditions? MeOH is not a very strong nucleophile.
evalFeedback	3	5	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	3	6	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	3	12	The nucleophilic atom--the one that makes the new bond to the electrophile--is the atom that bears a lone pair.
evalFeedback	3	13	The O-C bond of the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	3	14	In an SN2 reaction, the bond between the leaving group and the C atom to which it is attached is replaced with a bond between the nucleophilic atom and the same C atom.
In an SN1 reaction a carbocation is formed first, a rearrangement takes place if a more stable carbocation can be formed, and then the nucleophile attaches to this carbocation. 
You just need to decide if the reaction is an SN1 or SN2.
evalFeedback	4	1	Right!  Under these "stealth acidic" conditions, SN1 substitution occurs.  The Br^- leaves to give a secondary carbocation, which undergoes a 1,2-hydride shift to give a lower-energy tertiary carbocation.  CH3OH then adds to give the ether.
evalFeedback	4	2	Your answer is reasonable, but incorrect.  What is the mechanism of substitution in this reaction, and what annoying side reaction can occur in the course of that mechanism?
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	4	4	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	4	12	C-C bonds are unlikely to form or break under these conditions.
evalFeedback	4	13	The OCH3 group in the product should be either in the same place where the leaving group was in the starting material or attached to a more substituted C atom.
evalFeedback	5	1	Right!  A C-O bond replaces the C-Br bond, and one of the O-H bonds cleaves, too.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please draw a neutral product.
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw a single organic product.
evalFeedback	5	4	Br is a leaving group.  It is not incorporated into the product.
evalFeedback	5	5	What is the total number of C atoms from both of the starting materials? How many C atoms should the product contain?

evalFeedback	5	10	The O-C bond of the nucleophile is retained in the product.
evalFeedback	5	11	C-C bonds are unlikely to form or break under these conditions.
evalFeedback	5	12	Tertiary alkyl halides don't tend to rearrange, so the O-CH3 group in the product should be in the same place where the leaving group was in the starting material.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The major substitution product has undergone inversion of configuration at the electrophilic C in this SN2 reaction under basic conditions.  (In fact, elimination will predominate over substitution under these conditions.)
evalFeedback	6	2	Under basic conditions, the mechanism of substitution must be SN2.  What implication is there for the stereochemistry at the electrophilic C?

evalFeedback	6	4	The stereochemistry of the Me group is unaffected by the reaction.
evalFeedback	6	5	Please specify the configuration at the stereogenic C atoms.  Use a squiggly bond (Single Up or Down) if you need to indicate a mixture of configurations.

header			What nucleophile could be used to react with butyl bromide to prepare the following compound? If your answer is a metal salt, omit the metal and draw the compound as an anion.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct! The OH^- displaces the Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please draw only a single compound.
evalFeedback	1	3	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	1	4	Water is not a sufficiently powerful nucleophile to react with butyl bromide.
evalFeedback	1	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and put a negative charge on the heteroatom.  That's your nucleophile.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct! The CH3O^- displaces the Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please draw only a single compound.
evalFeedback	2	3	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	2	4	Methanol is not a sufficiently powerful nucleophile to react with butyl bromide.
evalFeedback	2	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and put a negative charge on the heteroatom.  That's your nucleophile.
evalFeedback	3	1	Correct! The HS^- displaces the Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	3	2	Correct! The S displaces the Br^- and loses an H atom to form the product.  H2S is a sufficiently powerful nucleophile to react with butyl bromide even in its neutral form.  Because H2S is a poisonous gas, probably the deprotonated form of the reagent would be used.
evalFeedback	3	3	Please draw only a single compound.
evalFeedback	3	4	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	3	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and put a negative charge on the heteroatom.  That's your nucleophile.
evalFeedback	4	1	Correct! The CH3CH2S^- displaces the Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	4	2	Correct! The S displaces the Br^- and loses an H atom to form the product.  Thiols are sufficiently powerful nucleophiles to react with alkyl halides even in their neutral form, but probably a base would be added to the reaction mixture to deprotonate the EtSH to give the thiolate, a more powerful nucleophile.
evalFeedback	4	3	Please draw only a single compound.
evalFeedback	4	4	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	4	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and put an H on the heteroatom.  That's your nucleophile.  Probably, base would be used to deprotonate it before it reacted.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct!  CH3NH2 displaces the Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	5	2	The neutral form of the amine is sufficiently nucleophilic to react directly with the butyl bromide.  Deprotonation of the amine is neither necessary nor desirable, because it requires a very strong base.
evalFeedback	5	3	Please draw only a single compound.
evalFeedback	5	4	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	5	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and add an H atom to the heteroatom (MarvinSketch does it automatically).  That's your nucleophile.  In this case, because the neutral amine is already a very good nucleophile, and because it's only a very weak base, it's better to make the nucleophile neutral rather than anionic.
evalFeedback	6	1	Correct! The CN^- displaces Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please draw a single compound.
evalFeedback	6	3	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	6	4	Although HCN could be used in conjunction with a base, HCN is a poisonous gas, so it would certainly be used in its anionic form.
evalFeedback	6	5	Disconnect the bond between the C(sp3) and C(sp), and put a negative charge on the C(sp).  That's your nucleophile.
evalFeedback	7	1	Correct! The CH3COO^- displaces Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	7	2	Please draw a single organic compound.
evalFeedback	7	3	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	7	4	Nucleophilicity is proportional to the basicity.  Acetic acid is a strong organic acid, hence a weak base and a weak nucleophile.  What could you do to make it a stronger nucleophile?
evalFeedback	7	5	Disconnect the bond between the C and the heteroatom, and put a negative charge on the heteroatom.  That's your nucleophile.
evalFeedback	8	1	Correct! The CH3-C#tripleC^- displaces Br^- to form the product.
evalFeedback	8	2	Please draw a single organic compound.
evalFeedback	8	3	The butyl group comes from the electrophile, so it can't be present in the nucleophile.
evalFeedback	8	4	CH3C#tripleCH would be deprotonated before reacting with the electrophile.  Draw it in its deprotonated form.
evalFeedback	8	5	Disconnect the bond between C(sp) and C(sp3) of the butyl group, and put a negative charge on the C(sp) that you just disconnected.  That's your nucleophile.

Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Carbocations
qStmt	1		Triphenylmethanol is insoluble in water, but when it is treated with concentrated H2SO4, a bright yellow solution results. As this yellow solution is diluted with water, its color disappears, and a precipitate of triphenylmethanol reappears. Suggest a structure for the bright yellow species.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! OH is protonated and becomes a very good leaving group. The carbocation that is formed is very stable.  It is yellow because of the conjugation that is established among all the Ph groups by the empty p orbital on the carbocationic center.
evalFeedback	1	2	This compound would not be bright yellow.  What would happen to the OH group after it is protonated?
evalFeedback	1	3	Please draw a single organic product.

evalFeedback	2	3	Which compound has the highest-energy pair of electrons available nearby to satisfy the carbocation's thirst for electrons?

evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  The carbocation derived from the N-containing compound is stabilized by resonance.  Among the two hydrocarbons, the compound with the lower energy C(sp2)-OTf bond is more difficult to ionize than the compound with the higher energy C(sp3)-OTf bond.
evalFeedback	5	2	In which compound can the derived carbocation be stabilized by resonance?
evalFeedback	5	3	Among the two hydrocarbons, which has the lower-energy C-OTf bond?  (Think about the effect of hybridization on energy.)
qStmt	6		Order the compounds from easiest to hardest to ionize under acidic conditions.
qdText	6	1	N-methyl-2-aza-3-norbornyl tosylate
qdText	6	2	1-aza-2-norbornyl tosylate
qdText	6	3	N-methyl-2-aza-5-norbornyl tosylate
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The carbocation derived from the 2-aza 3-tosylate is stabilized by resonance.  Although the N is adjacent to the carbocationic center in the bridgehead-N compound, geometric constraints prevent the orbital containing the N lone pair from overlapping with the empty p orbital of the carbocation, so there is no resonance stabilization of this carbocation.  As a result, the inductive effect of N takes over, so the closer the electronegative N atom is to the carbocation, the higher in energy it is.
evalFeedback	6	2	In which compound do geometric constraints prevent resonance?  If N cannot participate in resonance, what will be the effect of its electronegativity?
evalFeedback	6	3	Among the two compounds in which N is not at the bridgehead position, which can best stabilize the carbocation by resonance?

qdText	7	2	N-(4-(bromomethyl)phenyl)acetamide
qdText	7	3	triphenylmethanol
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  The paddlewheel-shaped compound cannot stabilize the carbocation by resonance because of geometric constraints.  The compound in which two benzene rings are linked with a CH2 group is best at stabilizing the carbocation by resonance because two of the rings are forced to be coplanar with the carbocation all of the time.
evalFeedback	7	2	Which compound gives a carbocation that cannot be stabilized by resonance with #pi bonds?  (Think geometry.)
evalFeedback	7	3	Among the compounds which can stabilize the carbocation by resonance, which is prevented from twisting all of its phenyl rings out of conjugation with the carbocation?
qStmt	8		Order the compounds from easiest to hardest to ionize under acidic conditions.
qdText	8	1	N-(3-(bromomethyl)phenyl)acetamide

qdText	8	3	4-(bromomethyl)phenyl acetate
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  The meta-substituted compound cannot stabilize the carbocation by resonance with a lone pair, whereas the para-substituted compounds can.  Among the para-substituted compounds, N is better at sharing its lone pair than O.
evalFeedback	8	2	Which compound gives a carbocation that cannot be stabilized by resonance with a lone pair?
evalFeedback	8	3	Among the compounds which can stabilize the carbocation by resonance with a lone pair, which has the higher-energy, more readily shared lone pair?

qdText	9	1	2-methyl-2-butyl fluoride
qdText	9	2	2-methyl-2-butyl chloride
qdText	9	3	2-methyl-2-butyl iodide
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  The bigger the halogen, the worse its overlap with the C(sp3) orbital, and the better its leaving group ability.
evalFeedback	9	2	Which is more important to leaving group ability: size or electronegativity?
evalFeedback	9	3	Cl must be intermediate between F and I in its properties.

evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  Both C atoms adjacent to the one bearing the Br have H atoms that are antiperiplanar to the Br, so Zaitsev's rule is followed, and the lowest energy (most substituted) alkene is obtained.

evalFeedback	8	5	Although syn elimination does occur sometimes, the eclipsed conformer is very high in energy, so it is difficult to achieve elimination from this conformation.  There is a better answer.<P>(If you alter your previous response, and you want to remove a group attached to the original two C atoms of the conformer template, replace it with an H atom; don't erase it.)

Topic: Substitution and elimination reactions; Set: Mechanisms
header			Draw a reasonable mechanism for this reaction.  All compounds involved in each stage of the mechanism must be enclosed in a box, and each box must be connected to the next one with a straight arrow.  Use electron-flow arrows to show the movement of electrons in each step.
evalFeedback	1	1	At least one of the specified starting materials is missing from your mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	2	The specified product is not obtained in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	1	3	The mechanism of this reaction does not involve free radicals.
evalFeedback	1	4	The species CH3^+ is extremely high in energy.  There is a much better answer.
evalFeedback	1	5	The purpose of protonating an OH group is to convert it into a better leaving group.  Although CH3OH2^+ can sometimes act as an electrophile in an SN2 reaction, it usually does so only when a powerful nucleophile is present, which is not the case in this reaction.  For this reason, protonation of CH3OH is not a productive step.  What else might be protonated more productively?
evalFeedback	1	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What is the normal mechanism of substitution under acidic conditions such as these?  What is the nature of the key intermediate in this mechanism?
evalFeedback	1	7	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  What must happen to the OH group before it can leave the ring C?
evalFeedback	1	8	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  When CH3OH adds to the carbocation, the O-H bond is not broken until a subsequent step.
evalFeedback	1	10	The reaction takes place under acidic conditions, so there should be no good bases present.
evalFeedback	1	11	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	1	12	Boxes containing resonance structures must be connected by a double-headed reaction arrow.
evalFeedback	1	13	Boxes connected by a double-headed reaction arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	1	14	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	1	15	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.  It's an SN1 substitution reaction.
evalFeedback	2	1	The mechanism you have drawn does not contain one or more of the specified starting materials.
evalFeedback	2	2	The specified product of the mechanism is not present in the mechanism you have drawn.

evalFeedback	2	10	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.
evalFeedback	3	1	Please use both provided starting materials in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	3	2	The specified product of the mechanism is not present in the mechanism you have drawn.
evalFeedback	3	3	This mechanism occurs under basic conditions.  (Note the presence of alkoxide anion, a good base.)  What kind of intermediates are ruled out?
evalFeedback	3	4	The mechanism of this reaction does not involve free radicals.
evalFeedback	3	5	CH3O^- is a good base and a good nucleophile, and the alkyl bromides are secondary.  Which is more likely to occur first: substitution or elimination?
evalFeedback	3	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  Don't try to do everything at once.
evalFeedback	3	8	What are the conditions under which this reaction occurs?  What kinds of species are not permitted under these conditions?
evalFeedback	3	9	No bases in this mechanism should have conjugate acids whose pKa > 30. The conditions are basic, but not extremely so.
evalFeedback	3	10	Although it's not dead wrong to do the substitution reaction before the elimination, substitution on the starting dibromide is difficult because of steric hindrance and because of the nearby electron-withdrawing Br atom.  It's more likely that elimination occurs first.
evalFeedback	3	11	Boxes connected by a double-headed reaction arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	3	12	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	3	13	From what I can tell, your mechanism appears to be correct.

evalFeedback	4	6	What are the conditions of this reaction?  What kinds of species are not permitted under these conditions?
evalFeedback	4	7	Most chemists would draw the protonated alcohol as a discrete intermediate.
evalFeedback	4	8	Boxes connected by a double-headed reaction arrow must contain resonance structures.
evalFeedback	4	9	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	4	10	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.

evalFeedback	6	5	This reaction does not involve free radicals.
evalFeedback	6	6	Your mechanism is missing a key intermediate.  Don't try to execute too many electron-flow steps at once.
evalFeedback	6	8	HBr is a coproduct of this reaction, so no halfway decent bases should be generated in the course of the reaction.
evalFeedback	6	9	No step should contain an acid and a base that satisfy the condition, the pKa of the conjugate acid of the base minus the pKa of the acid > 8 (the pKa rule).
evalFeedback	6	10	Primary carbocations are very high in energy, and it is unlikely that one would form.
evalFeedback	6	11	Your mechanism has an insufficient number of steps.  Don't try to execute too many mechanistic steps at once.
evalFeedback	6	12	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.
evalFeedback	6	13	Although it is possible that the 1,2-alkyl shift could occur concerted with loss of Br^-, in this particular example, because the intermediate would be a reasonably stable 2&deg; carbocation, it is more likely that a discrete intermediate intervenes.
evalFeedback	6	14	Boxes connected by a double-headed arrow must contain resonance structures; in your mechanism, they do not.
evalFeedback	6	15	No atom should simultaneously receive and supply unshared electrons.
evalFeedback	6	16	Good!  Your mechanism appears to be reasonable.

evalFeedback	10	9	Primary carbocations are very high in energy, and it is unlikely that one would form.
evalFeedback	10	10	When an atom acts as a nucleophile, it normally uses the electrons in a lone pair, a #pi bond, or a #sigma bond to a metal to make the new bond, not those in a #sigma bond to H.  If the atom must use the electrons in the #sigma bond to H, deprotonate the atom first to give it a lone pair that it can use subsequently.

evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  The diamine condenses with the disulfonyl chloride to make a poly(sulfonamide).
evalFeedback	3	2	Not a bad answer, but the fact that this compound contains two groups that will react with one another means that it can't be the monomer (which must be a stable compound).  Besides, you're told that two monomers are required.
evalFeedback	3	3	This polymer is best made from two bifunctional monomers.
evalFeedback	3	4	The N-S bond is particularly easy to  make, so it is made in the course of polymerization, and it is not present in the monomer.

evalFeedback	4	2	No, this compound is extremely unstable and can't be used as a monomer.
evalFeedback	4	3	All of the #sigma bonds within the repeating unit of the polymer (but not those connecting each repeating unit with the next) are present in the monomer.
evalFeedback	4	4	The monomer must have at least one #pi bond.

evalFeedback	5	2	Right!  In polymerization of this monomer, the terminal O of one monomer attacks the carbonyl of the next to displace H2O.
evalFeedback	5	3	Right!  In polymerization of this monomer, the methylene C of one monomer attacks the ring CH2 of the next to displace O, making an enolate, which attacks the next monomer.
evalFeedback	5	4	Close, but the fact that this compound contains two groups that will react with one another means that it can't be the monomer (which must be a stable compound).
evalFeedback	5	5	Please draw a neutral monomer.

evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  The diol condenses with the diester, diacid, or diacyl chloride to make poly(butylene terephthalate).
evalFeedback	7	2	Both C-O single bonds in the polymer are best formed by condensation of two monomers.  In other words, two monomers are used to prepare this compound, and neither one contains the C-O single bonds found in the polymer.

qStmt	8		<P>[Polyethylene glycol is widely used as a binder, thickening agent, and packaging additive for foods. The systematic name for polyethylene glycol (PEG) is poly(ethylene oxide).]
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!  The epoxide polymerizes so that the O atom of one monomer opens the epoxide ring of the next, giving a CH2-CH2-O repeating unit.
evalFeedback	8	2	In theory, PEG could also be made by intermolecular dehydration of ethylene glycol, the structure you drew, but the yields are low and the chains are short. What other monomer can be used to synthesize PEG?
evalFeedback	8	3	All of the #sigma bonds within the repeating unit of the polymer (but not those connecting each repeating unit with the next) are present in the monomer.
evalFeedback	8	4	Although in principle, a 2-haloalcohol could be used to prepare this monomer, the monomer actually used contains no halogens.  What other electrophilic functional group could the monomer contain?
evalFeedback	8	5	The formula of the monomer equals the formula of the repeating unit.

evalFeedback	9	3	All of the #sigma bonds within the repeating unit of the polymer (but not those connecting each repeating unit with the next) are present in the monomer.
evalFeedback	9	4	Polymerization of a monomer with only one #pi bond would give a product with no double bonds.

evalFeedback	1	5	The formula of the monomer equals the formula of the repeating unit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  When CH2=CH2 is polymerized, the product is (-CH2-CH2-)<sub><i>n</i></sub>.  It follows that when the product is (-CH2-CH(Py)-)<sub><i>n</i></sub>, the monomer is most likely CH2=CH-Py.
evalFeedback	2	2	The repeating unit has a pyridine ring, so the monomer must have one, also.

evalFeedback	3	2	The monomer must have a reactive functionality that can be polymerized.  A polymer with an all-carbon backbone is usually made by polymerization of an alkene or an alkyne.

evalFeedback	1	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		Press the C button and click in the window to redraw the C.  Then press the O button, click and hold on the C, drag the cursor away, and release.  You should show C-O.  Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!
evalFeedback	2	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	3		LewisSketch does not "see" implicit H atoms, so you have to draw the H atoms in.  Draw C-C by clicking on the Bond tool, then clicking on the canvas.  Convert one of the C atoms to O by clicking on the O button, then clicking on one of the C atoms.  Now attach two H atoms to the C atom, and then click once on the existing C-O bond to convert it to a C=O bond.  You should have H2C=O.  Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Double-clicking on an existing single bond will make it a triple bond, and single-clicking on a double or triple bond will make it a single bond.  You don't have to switch to the bond tool (the horizontal button) to change a bond's order.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please follow the instructions.

Topic: Tutorials; Set: Energy diagrams
qStmt	1		Now let's draw the molecular orbitals of H2O (see figure). 

<ol><li>We need to place in the left column four O(sp3) orbitals of equal energy containing a total of six electrons. To place four sp3 orbitals at a single energy level, change 1 to 4 in the first pulldown menu in the "Add..." instruction. Now click in the middle of the first column; five pulldown menus will appear. Change <i>s</i> to sp3 in the first menu, place two electrons in each of the next two menus, and place one electron in each of the remaining two menus. 

</li><li>Next, we need to place two singly occupied H(<i>s</i>) orbitals on the right. Change 4 to 2 in the first pulldown menu in the "Add..." instruction, click in the third column at an energy level slightly <i>below</i> the energy level of the O(sp3) orbitals, and place one electron in each of these two orbitals.

</li><li> Next, we need to place the molecular (and nonbonding atomic) orbitals in the middle column. In this column, click once below the level of the H(<i>s</i>) orbitals, once at exactly the level of the O(sp3) orbitals, and once above the level of the O(sp3) orbitals. Change the type of the lowest orbital group to #sigma, and place two electrons in each orbital; change the type of the middle orbital group to sp3, and place two electrons in each orbital; and change the type of the top orbital group to #sigma*. 

</li><li>Finally, we need to show which atomic orbitals contribute to the molecular orbitals. Connect the group of four O(sp3) orbitals on the left to all three orbital groups in the middle column, and connect the group of two H(<i>s</i>) orbitals to the groups of #sigma and #sigma* orbitals in the middle column. 

</li></ol>Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Great! You can change the type of orbital with either the bottom pulldown menu or the pulldown menu in the diagram, but you have to choose the number of orbitals in each group before you place them.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		Now we'll draw a reaction coordinate diagram of a single set of reactants leading to two different products, in which the thermodynamic product (lower in energy) is also the kinetic product (obtained more quickly, via the lower-energy transition state). Place <i>one</i> menu in the middle of the first column, <i>two</i> at the top of the second column (at different energy levels), and <i>two</i> at the bottom of the third column (likewise). Choose the name "reactants" from the menu in the first column, "transition state" from <i>both</i> menus in the second, and "product" from <i>both</i> menus in the third. Next, by clicking on bullets next to the appropriate menus, connect the reactants menu to <i>both</i> transition state menus. Then connect the <i>upper</i> transition state menu to the <i>upper</i> products menu, and connect the <i>lower</i> transition state menu to the <i>lower</i> products menu. If, at any point, you connect the wrong menus, simply click again on the bullets adjacent to each of the incorrectly connected menus, and the line will disappear. (Clicking a menu's bullet also selects the menu for moving or deleting; click elsewhere in the diagram to move it, or press Delete to delete it.) Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good! If you were to correlate the lower energy transition state with the higher energy product, and vice versa, then you would have a reaction coordinate diagram in which the kinetic product was not the thermodynamic product.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please follow the instructions. To delete a menu, click on a dot adjacent to it so that a blue box appears around it, and press Delete. To move a menu, click on a dot adjacent to it, and then click elsewhere in the diagram. Press Refresh if you resize the browser window. If, at any point, you connect the wrong menus, simply click on the dots adjacent to each of the incorrectly connected menus, and the line will disappear. If you need to delete a menu, click on a dot adjacent to it, and press the Delete button.
qStmt	3		A reaction coordinate diagram describes the energy of compounds undergoing a reaction as the reaction proceeds from starting materials, through intermediates, to products, as in the figure. The <i>y</i> axis represents the energy of the compounds, and the <i>x</i> axis represents the progress of the reaction as it proceeds from beginning to end. (You can think of the <i>x</i> axis as representing time, although it's not really time.) In a reaction coordinate diagram question in ACE, you place energy minima and maxima in appropriate positions along the reaction coordinate. The reaction coordinate is divided into a specific number of stages, or columns; this example has three. To place an energy minimum or maximum in a column, simply mouse over the column, look for the words "Drop it here!" to appear, and click; a pulldown menu will appear, from which you can choose the appropriate name of the energy minimum or maximum. In this particular example, you are going to reproduce the reaction coordinate in the figure. Click in the middle of the first column, the top of the second column, and the bottom of the third column. Choose the name "reactants" from the first pulldown menu, "transition state" from the second, and "products" from the third. Next, mouse over a bullet adjacent to the reactants menu until a blue box appears around the menu, and click; then do the same for the transition state menu. The blue box around the first menu will disappear, and a blue line will connect these two menus. Finally, connect the transition state menu to the products menu in the same way. Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good! Actually, in a reaction coordinate diagram with exactly one energy minimum or maximum in each column, the connecting lines are optional, but the diagram looks nicer if you add them. Use the Refresh button if you resize the browser window.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please follow the instructions. To delete a menu, click on a dot adjacent to it so that a blue box appears around it, and press Delete. To move a menu, click on a dot adjacent to it, and then click elsewhere in the diagram. Press Refresh if you resize the browser window.
qStmt	4		In an orbital energy diagram, the orbitals of two atoms or molecule fragments combine to make a new set of molecular orbitals. The y-axis represents energy, and the x-axis is dimensionless. There are always three columns in an orbital energy diagram. The orbitals of the atoms or molecule fragments appear in the left and right columns, and the new molecular orbitals appear in the middle column. To place an orbital or group of orbitals in a column, simply mouse over the column, look for the words "Drop it here!" to appear, and click; several pulldown menus will appear, from which you can choose the appropriate name of the orbital(s) and the appropriate number of electrons in each. <p>We'll start by reproducing the molecular orbital diagram for H2 in the figure. Click in the middle of the first column to add a single s orbital. The orbital is represented by a pair of pulldown menus: one shows the orbital type, and the other shows the number of electrons in that orbital. Use the right-hand pulldown menu to set the number of electrons in that s orbital to one. Now, repeat these steps in the third column, placing the orbital at exactly the same energy level as you did on the left. Now, click twice in the second column, once above and once below the energy levels of the s orbitals. Change the type of the bottom orbital from <i>s</i> to #sigma, and set the number of electrons to two. Now, change the type of the top orbital from <i>s</i> to #sigma*. <p>The last thing to do is to correlate the s orbitals with the #sigma and #sigma* orbitals. Mouse over a bullet adjacent to the s orbital menus in the first column until a blue box appears around them, and click; then do the same for the #sigma orbital menus in the second column. Upon the second click, the blue box around the first set of menus will disappear, and a blue line will connect the s orbital menus to the #sigma orbital menus. Next, again mouse over a bullet adjacent to the s orbital menus in the first column until a blue box appears around them, and click; then do the same for the #sigma* orbital menus in the second column. A blue line will connect the s orbital menus to the #sigma* orbital menus. Repeat for the s orbital in the third column, and then submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	5		You can also use the reaction coordinate diagram drawing tool to draw a graph of energy vs. dihedral angle about a C-C bond. In this exercise, you will draw a diagram of energy vs. H-C&#8211;C-H dihedral angle in ethane. The first, third, and fifth columns represent eclipsed conformers (dihedral angles of 0&#176;, 120&#176;, and 240&#176;), which are high in energy, whereas the second, fourth, and sixth columns represent staggered conformers (dihedral angles of 60&#176;, 180&#176;, and 300&#176;), which are low in energy. Mouse over column 1 toward the top of the column, click to place a pulldown menu there, and then choose <b>eclipsed</b> from the pulldown menu. Repeat in columns 3 and 5, placing the pulldown menu at the same height as in column 1. Now, mouse over column 2 toward the bottom of the column, click to place a pulldown menu there, and then choose <b>staggered</b> from the pulldown menu. Repeat in columns 4 and 6, placing the pulldown menu at the same height as in column 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Excellent! You can also connect the pulldown menus in adjacent columns with lines, but it's not necessary, because there's only one pulldown menu in each column, so ACE can figure it out itself.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please follow the instructions.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS tutorial
qStmt	1		Draw methane (CH4). Click on the C button and then click on the drawing area to draw methane. Note how the H atoms are automatically added to bring the C valence up to 4. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct!
evalFeedback	1	2	No, that's not methane (CH4).  Try again.
qStmt	2		Draw ethane (CH3-CH3). Press the C button and click in the window to redraw methane (CH4). Now click on the Bond button (the third button on the western toolbar), place the cursor over the C atom (a blue circle will appear around the atom), click and hold, drag the cursor in whatever direction you want the new bond to go, and release. You should now have ethane. Note how the number of H atoms on the original C atom changes automatically to give it the correct valence. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct!
evalFeedback	2	2	That's not ethane (CH3-CH3).  Try again.
qStmt	3		Redraw ethane (CH3-CH3) by clicking on the Bond button and then clicking in the window. Now add more carbons to your structure by clicking or click-hold-dragging on existing C atoms until you have drawn 2-methylbutane, the structure shown in the figure. If you make a mistake, you can use the Undo button (the fourth button on the northern toolbar) or the Erase button (the second button on the western toolbar). Note that the middle C atoms no longer show C or H labels; this representation of a molecule, in which vertices represent C atoms, and each C atom is assumed to have enough H atoms to bring its valence to 4, is called a <b>skeletal</b> drawing. Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!
evalFeedback	3	2	That's not 2-methylbutane.  Your answer should have a chain of four C atoms with one additional C atom attached to one of the middle C atoms of the chain.  Try again.
qStmt	4		Press the bond tool button, place the cursor over the bond between the two rightmost C atoms of the structure in the Marvin window (a blue line will encircle the bond), and click once to change it to a double bond. You should now have the structure shown in Figure 2, 3-methyl-1-butene.  Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	You clicked on the wrong C-C bond.  Press the Bond tool, click on the double bond again to change it back to a signle bond, and try again.
evalFeedback	4	3	That's not 3-methyl-1-butene.  Try again.
qStmt	5		Click on the lower right corner of the Bond button so that a submenu appears. Click on the Pen button in the submenu; the submenu should disappear, and the main Bond button should now show the pen. Next, place the cursor over the rightmost bond in the structure in the Marvin window (a blue line will encircle the bond), and click twice on the bond to change it to a triple bond. You should now have the structure shown in Figure 2, 3-methyl-1-butyne. Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good. The default Bond tool toggles bonds between single and double only, whereas the Pen tool converts a bond from single to double to triple and back to single.
evalFeedback	5	2	That's not 3-methyl-1-butyne.  Try again.
qStmt	6		Click on the O button, and then click on C^1, the leftmost C atom, to change it into an OH group. You should now have 2-butanol, the structure shown in Figure 2. (Note how the valence of the O atom is automatically satisfied by the addition of an H atom.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  To see the lone pairs on the O atom, press the View Settings button (represented by a gear icon) on the far right of the northern toolbar. (If you don't see the gear icon, press and hold the right arrow on the far right of the northern toolbar until it comes into sight.) Check the Show lone pairs box, and press OK.
evalFeedback	6	2	That's not 2-butanol.  Try again.
qStmt	7		Click on the O button, click-and-hold on C^1 (the uppermost C atom), drag until you see a faint line sprout from the C atom, and release to add another OH group. You should have 1,2-butanediol, the structure shown in Figure 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!
evalFeedback	7	2	That's not 1,2-butanediol.  Try again.
qStmt	8		Press the O button. Click-and-hold on C^1 (the uppermost C atom), drag until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release to add an OH group. Now press the Bond button, and click on the new C-O bond to turn it into a C=O double bond. You should now have 2-hydroxybutanal, the structure shown in Figure 2. (Again, note how the H atom is automatically removed from O when the single bond is changed to a double bond.) Submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!
evalFeedback	8	2	You clicked on the wrong C-O bond.  Press the Bond tool, and click once on the C=O double bond to convert it back to a single bond.  Then convert the other C-O bond to a C=O bond.
evalFeedback	8	3	That's not 2-hydroxybutanal.  Try again.
qStmt	9		Click on the benzene button (the six-membered ring with three alternating double bonds) in the southern toolbar, and click in the drawing area near the OH group to add a benzene ring near the OH group.  Now click on the bond button, click-and-hold on the O atom (from the OH group), drag the cursor to any one of the C atoms of the benzene ring, and release. You should have now 2-phenoxybutanal, the structure shown in Figure 2. (Again, note how the valence of the O atom is automatically corrected.) Submit.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  Now, to see all the H atoms in condensed format, click the View settings button (the gear icon), choose All from the Implicit H pulldown menu, and press OK. To see all the H atoms drawn out explicitly, press the H&plusmn; button in the northern toolbar (two buttons to the left of the gear icon). Press it again to remove the explicit H atoms. Now, use the Select tool (first button on western toolbar) to select an atom or group of atoms, and press H&plusmn; to draw explicitly the H atoms of just the selected atoms.
evalFeedback	9	2	That's not 2-phenoxybutanal.  Try again.
qStmt	10		Press the Chain button (just below the Bond button on the western toolbar). Click-hold on the canvas and drag until four C atoms in a zigzag chain (butane) appear. Now press the Bond button, and click on the bond connecting the middle C atoms to convert it into a double bond. You will now have <i>trans</i>-2-butene, the structure shown in Figure 1. To convert it into <i>cis</i>-2-butene, the structure shown in Figure 2, press the Select button (top button on the western toolbar), click-and-hold on one of the terminal C atoms, and drag it so that the four C atoms form a U shape instead of a zigzag shape. Submit.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  If you have not already learned about stereoisomerism in alkenes (you would know it if you have), this exercise will not be very meaningful to you.  But remember to review this exercise when you reach that subject.
evalFeedback	10	2	You've drawn the trans isomer.  The four C atoms should be in a U shape, not a zigzag shape.
evalFeedback	10	3	You've drawn the compound in such a way that ACE can't determine whether it's cis or trans.  The four C atoms should be in a U or C shape.
evalFeedback	10	4	That's not the correct structure.  Try again.
qStmt	11		Draw sodium ethoxide. First draw ethanol (CH3CH2OH): click on the bond tool, click on the canvas to draw CH3-CH3, click on the O button, click-and-hold on one of the C atoms (it will be encircled in blue), drag in any direction until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release. Now type Na. Click and hold on the O atom of the OH group (it will be encircled in blue), drag in any direction until a faint line sprouts from the O atom, and release. Submit.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  You can bring up almost any element this way, or you can bring up any element by pressing the Periodic Table button (top of the eastern toolbar) and clicking on the appropriate element.  You can also bring up the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium, by typing D or T, respectively.
evalFeedback	11	2	That's not sodium ethoxide (CH3CH2ONa).  Try again.

Click on any MarvinJS button, and type the appropriate keystroke for Paste on your computer (Mac users: command-V). Click anywhere on the canvas to unselect the pasted structure, and submit. <b>Note</b>: Please be careful to read the feedback when you answer this question correctly.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  You can also copy a structure already in your MarvinJS window. Press the Select button, double-click any part of the structure (or click-hold away from it and then drag a box around it), click-hold any part of the structure (but not the pink target symbol in the middle), drag it to the northern part of the canvas, and release. Now type the appropriate keystroke for Paste to put another copy of the structure on the canvas. You can move the structure that you just pasted by click-holding any part of it and dragging it to the south.
evalFeedback	12	2	No, that's not right.  Try again.
qStmt	13		Draw 4-acetylbenzoic acid (Figure 1). First click on the benzene ring template (sixth button in the southern toolbar), and click on the canvas.  To add the first CO2H group, type CO^2H, and press Return. Now click-hold on one of the benzene C atoms, drag until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release.  <p>You cannot use the same method to add an Ac (acetyl, &minus;C(=O)CH3), CN (cyano, &minus;C#tripleN), or Pr (propyl, &minus;CH2CH2CH3) group, because these two-letter abbreviations also represent elements (if you ignore case for CN). To add the Ac (acetyl) group, either press the space bar, or press the abbreviated groups dialog button (first button on the southern toolbar; it looks like a pair of brackets with a pile of books). Type Ac, and press OK. Click-hold on the benzene C atom opposite the CO2H group, drag until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release. Submit. <b>Note</b>: Please be careful to read the feedback when you answer this question correctly.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good!  You can add many different groups &#8212; OMe, CO2Me, Ph, iPr, etc. &#8212; in this way. <p>Now, to see what the Ac or CO2H symbol represents, right-click (Mac users: control-click) on it and choose <b>Expand and Clean</b> or <b>Ungroup and Clean</b>. If you choose <b>Expand and Clean</b>, then mousing over the expanded group will enclose it in brackets and show the symbol of this group.
evalFeedback	13	2	Oops! Your structure needs to have a six-membered ring with three alternating double bonds (a benzene ring).
evalFeedback	13	3	You attached an actinium (Ac) atom, not an acetyl (Ac) group, to the ring. To add an Ac group, you need to use the abbreviated group dialong box. Press the space bar to access it, type Ac, and press OK, and then click on the Ac atom in your structure. Note that the Ac symbol for actinium is brown, but the Ac symbol for acetyl is black.
evalFeedback	13	4	No, that's not 4-acetylbenzoic acid.  Try again.
qStmt	14		Use the options in the second row of the submenu of the Bond toolbar to draw bonds that indicate stereochemistry. Click on the bottom right corner of the Bond button, click on the second button in the second row (the bold bond), and click on the C-NH2 bond. Then click on the bottom right corner of the Bond button, click on the third button in the second row (the hashed bond), and click on the C-Cl bond. Then click on the bottom right corner of the Bond button, click on the fourth button in the second row (the wavy bond), and click on the C-OH bond. You should have the structure shown in Fig. 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	14	1	Right!  You can also change the type of an existing bond by right-clicking (Mac users: control-click) on it, clicking on the <b>Bond properties</b> option, and choosing the appropriate bond (<b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, or <b>single up or down</b>) from the <b>Type</b> pulldown menu. Change the direction of the wedge by clicking on it again with the same bond type selected from the Bond button submenu. <P>You may want to work the Stereochemistry Tutorial to learn more about how to indicate stereochemistry in Marvin and how Marvin interprets stereochemistry in drawings.
evalFeedback	14	2	One of your bond wedges is oriented in the wrong direction.  All should have their narrow end at the C.  Select from the Bond submenu the button that represents the type of bond that is reversed, and click on the existing wedge to reverse its direction.
evalFeedback	14	3	Please make all three vertical bonds into the appropriate types.
evalFeedback	14	4	Please make sure you haven't changed the structure except for the stereochemistry of the three vertical bonds.
qStmt	15		Draw ^+CH2-CH2&bull; (Figure 1).  First draw ethane (CH3-CH3) by pressing the Bond button and clicking in the window. Now press the + button (fifth button on the western toolbar) and click on one of the C atoms. [Clicking on any atom with the + (or &minus;) button will increase (or decrease) its charge.] Next, press the Radical button (third from the bottom on the western toolbar; its icon is a bullet &bull;, and you may have to scroll the toolbar down to see it), and then click on the other C atom to convert it to a radical. You should have the structure shown in Figure 1. Submit, and make sure you read the feedback.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right! To remove a radical using the &bull; button, press the &bull; button and click on the atom four times. Or, you can click on the C button and then click on a C radical to remove the radical. <p>You've seen the most essential features of MarvinJS, and you're now ready to tackle the problems.  If you ever need to do anything in MarvinJS that you don't know how to do, search the Internet for the "Marvin JS User Guide".  When you begin to tackle stereochemistry problems, be sure to work the MarvinJS stereochemistry tutorial to learn some of the intricacies of how ACE interprets the stereochemistry of your drawings.
evalFeedback	15	2	That's not the right answer.  Try again.
qStmt	16		Sometimes the Marvin JS canvas is not large enough for the structure or structures you are drawing. To resize the structure, you use one of the buttons in the Zoom group. Your northern toolbar will show the Zoom all button, a magnifying glass with a &times; inside. Pressing this button will resize the structure so it is as large as possible but still fits 100% on the canvas. Click on the lower right corner of the Zoom all button to bring up a submenu with the Zoom in and Zoom out buttons. Play around with the canvas resizing and the Zoom functions, and then submit.
evalFeedback	16	1	Good! If you desire a bigger canvas, you can press the full-size sketcher button, the third button from the right in the southern toolbar. Any changes you make in the full-size sketcher will be reflected in the original sketcher.
qStmt	17		The last three buttons on the southern toolbar can be very useful. First, press the third-to-last button on the southern toolbar, the one with four arrows pointing outward from the center. A new MarvinJS window will open up to fill your screen entirely. This window is very useful when you are making large drawings. MarvinJS will copy everything you draw in the big window into your original window, so you can close the big window when you are finished with your structure. In the current case, draw ethanol (CH3CH2OH) in the big window: click on the bond tool, click on the canvas to draw CH3-CH3, click on the O button, click-and-hold on one of the C atoms (it should be highlighted in green), drag in any direction until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release. Now close the big window; you will see the structure of ethanol in the original window. <p>Now press the second-to-last button on the bottom toolbar, the one with the icon C<sub>m</sub>H<sub>n</sub>X<sub>p</sub>. A new window will open showing the formula, molecular weight, exact mass, and elemental analysis of the structure that you drew. This kind of information can be very useful at times. Finally, the last button allows you to measure a distance between two selected atoms, the angle defined by three selected contiguous atoms, or the dihedral angle defined by four selected contiguous atoms. Submit.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!
evalFeedback	17	2	Please follow the instructions.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS resonance tutorial
qStmt	1		ACE provides three toolbar buttons for drawing resonance structures: the Straight arrow/Reaction group (icon is + above &rarr;), the Electron flow group (icon is a curved arrow starting at a lone pair), and the Rectangle group. They are located toward the bottom of the western toolbar. (If you don't see them, scroll the toolbar down by pressing the down arrow in the lower left-hand corner of the Marvin JS window.) <ul><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the electron-flow arrow group, a submenu of two buttons appears: the regular curved arrow (to show the movement of a pair of electrons), and the fishhook or half-headed curved arrow (to show the movement of a single electron). </li><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the reaction arrow group, a submenu of three buttons appears: the reaction arrow, the resonance arrow, and an equilibrium arrow. Click on the resonance arrow button to make it appear in the main toolbar button. </li><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the rectangle group, a submenu of two buttons appears: the rectangle and the ellipse. You will not need to use the ellipse in ACE. </li></ul><p>When drawing electron-flow arrows to show how resonance structures are related to one another, electron-flow arrows start at &#960; bonds, lone pairs, or unshared single electrons, and they end at bonds or atoms. In the following example, you need to draw an electron-flow arrow on the left-hand structure that shows that the pair of electrons in the C=O &#960; bond moves to become a lone pair on the O atom. First, click on the two-electron electron-flow arrow button. Now, click-and-hold on the C=O double bond in the structure in the left-hand box. Drag the cursor to the right until the O atom is encircled in blue, and release. There should now be an electron-flow arrow pointing from the C=O double bond to the O atom. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Good! Please continue to the next exercise.
qStmt	2		Given any two resonance structures A and B, you can draw electron-flow arrows on A to show how the electrons can move to give B, or you can draw electron-flow arrows on B to show how the electrons can move to give A. This is true regardless of the locations of A and B on the canvas. <p>In this example, you will draw an electron-flow arrow on the <b><i>right</i></b>-hand structure that shows that one of the lone pairs of electrons on O can move to between the C and O atoms, giving the &#960; bond shown on the <b><i>left</i></b>. First, click on the two-electron electron-flow arrow button. Now, click (and release, not hold) on the O atom in the structure in the <b><i>right</i></b>-hand box. In the magnified image that appears, click-and-hold on one of the lone pairs. Drag the cursor to the C-O bond in the same structure until it is encircled in blue, and release. In the right-hand box, there should now be an electron-flow arrow pointing from the O atom to the C-O bond. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please draw your electron-flow arrow in the <b><i>right</i></b>-hand box, and do not alter the structure.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	3	Good! Please continue to the next exercise.
qStmt	3		In this example, you will draw an electron-flow arrow that shows how the electrons in a &#960; bond can move to form a new &#960; bond. First, click on the two-electron electron-flow arrow button. Now, click-and-hold on the C=C double bond in the structure in the left-hand box. Drag the cursor to the left until the C-CH2^+ bond is encircled in blue, and release. There should now be an electron-flow arrow pointing from the C=C double bond to the C-CH2^+ bond, as shown in Figure 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Please follow the instructons.
evalFeedback	3	2	Good!
qStmt	4		It is perfectly OK to use more than one electron-flow arrow to show the movement of electrons in resonance. In the following example, click on the rectangle tool in the western toolbar, click-hold on the canvas and drag to draw one box just around the left-hand structure, and repeat to draw another one just around the right-hand structure. The two boxes cannot overlap, and they should not be very close to one another; if they are, use the Select tool to change their size or move them apart. Now, on the western toolbar, click the lower right-hand corner of the reaction arrow button (just above the electron-flow arrow button) to bring up the submenu of three buttons, and click on the resonance arrow (the second box). Now, hover the mouse over one of the boxes so that it is enclosed in blue lines. Click-and-hold on one of the corners or edge midpoints of the box (indicated by a small box), drag to any of the corners or edge midpoints of the other box until the other box is also highlighted, and release. (Alternatively, you can place either endpoint of the resonance arrow anywhere <i>inside</i> a box.) Now, click on the electron-flow arrow button. Click on the N atom of the structure on the left. Click-and-hold on the lone pair, drag the cursor to the N-C bond until it is encircled in blue, and release. Next, on the same structure, click-and-hold on the vertical C=C double bond, drag the cursor down and to the left until the lowest C-C single bond is encircled in blue, and release. Finally, on the same structure, click-and-hold on the diagonal C=C double bond, drag the cursor to the left until the C atom directly across the ring from the N atom is encircled in blue, and release. You should now have a drawing similar to the one in Figure 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Please follow the instructions. You should have one arrow originating at N and pointing to the C-N single bond; one originating at the vertical C=C double bond and ending at the bottommost C-C single bond; and one originating at the diagonal C=C double bond and ending at the C atom opposite the ring from N.
evalFeedback	4	2	Good! You can draw two, three, or more electron-flow arrows on any structure.
qStmt	5		In this example, you will use <b>three</b> one-electron electron-flow arrows to show the migration of an unpaired electron <b>and</b> the electrons in a &#960; bond. First, on the western toolbar, click the lower right-hand corner of the electron-flow arrow group to bring up the submenu of two buttons, and click on the fishhook or half-headed curved arrow (the second box). Now, in the left-hand box, click on the C atom that has an unpaired electron. In the magnified image that appears, click-and-hold on the electron. Drag the cursor to the C-CH2&#183; bond in the same structure until it is encircled in blue, and release. Now, click-and-hold on the C=C double bond in the same structure, drag the cursor to the left until the C-CH2&#183; bond in the same structure is encircled in blue, and release. Finally, again, click-and-hold on the C=C double bond in the same structure, but this time, drag the cursor to the right until the right-hand C atom of the C=C double bond is encircled in blue, and release. You should now have the structure and arrows shown in Figure 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	5	2	Good! Drawing resonance structures involving unpaired electrons usually required several one-electron electron-flow arrows.
qStmt	6		In resonance structure questions (and in mechanism questions as well), ACE will automatically add the appropriate number of lone pairs to a structure to match its valence and charge. You should not try to add lone pairs yourself. Do not activate the single-electron button (second-to-last button on the western toolbar, symbol is &bull;) and click twice on an atom to give it a lone pair. In the given example, someone has done just that. Note the highlighting of the central C atom as having an incorrect valence. That's because MarvinJS assumes that each single electron occupies its own orbital, so it interprets the central C atom as having five valence orbitals! Try submitting this structure. Then get rid of the unpaired electrons: right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the central C atom, choose <b>Atom properties</b>, change the selection in the <b>Radical</b> menu from <b>divalent</b> to <b>none</b>, and press <b>Ok</b>. Note how ACE automatically places a lone pair on the C atom, and the valence error highlighting is now gone. Submit.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good! You can toggle lone pair display if you want, regardless of whether the question presets it. Scroll the northern toolbar to the left, click on the gear icon, and check or uncheck the box next to <b>Show lone pairs</b>.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please follow the instructions.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS stereochemistry tutorial
qStmt	1		Click on the lower right corner of the Bond button (third button in western toolbar) so that a submenu appears. Click on the bold bond button in the submenu (second button in second row); the submenu should disappear, and the main Bond button should now show the bold bond.  Click on the C-O bond to change it to a bold wedge, and submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good.
evalFeedback	1	2	The wide end of the wedge should point toward O.   Click again on the C-OH bond to change the direction of the wedge.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		The type of bond (bold, hashed, or wavy) is easily changed.  Bring up the Bond submenu again, and click on the hashed bond button (third button in second row). Now click on the C-O bond to change it to a hashed wedge.  Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good.
evalFeedback	2	2	The wide end of the wedge should point toward O.   Click again on the C-OH bond to change the direction of the wedge.
evalFeedback	2	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	3		There's another way to change the nature of the bond.  Right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the C-O bond, click on Bond properties, choose "single up or down" from the Type pulldown menu, and press Ok. The bold bond will change to a wavy bond. Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Use the wavy bond to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.  If the configuration is unknown or unspecified, just use a regular single bond.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	4		You can also draw a stereo bond from scratch.  Bring up the Bond submenu again, and click on the hashed bond button (third button in second row). Now click on C atoms 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the molecule in the window so that CH3 groups with hashed bonds sprout from each one. Now press the O button, and click on the four CH3 groups that you just drew to convert them into OH groups. You should now have the structure in Figure 2. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  To convert a stereo bond back to a regular bond, bring up the Bond submenu again, click on the single bond button (second button in first row), and click on the stereo bond.  Or you can right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the bond, click on Bond properties, choose "single" from the Type pulldown menu, and press Ok. Or you can type 1 and click on the bond.  (Type 5, 6, or 7 to activate the bold, hashed, or wavy bond, respectively.) The possibilities are almost endless!
evalFeedback	4	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	5		Be careful in which direction your wedges point.  The North American convention is for the pointed end of a wedge (bold, hashed, or squiggly) to be at the stereogenic atom, but Marvin sometimes puts the wedge in the wrong direction.  Activate the bold bond button, and click <i>once</i> on the bond between the central N and the C atom to its right.  Note how the narrow end of the bond is at N, not at the stereogenic C atom.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good.  The narrow end of the bond originates correctly (according to North American convention) at the stereogenic atom.  Even if you point the wide end of a bond toward the stereogenic atom, ACE is programmed to understand what you mean -- but your instructor might not be so programmed, so don't get into the habit!
evalFeedback	5	2	You've put the wide end of the hashed bond at the stereogenic atom, which is the correct direction according to European convention, but that's not what you were asked to do. Please click again on the hashed bond to reverse its direction.
evalFeedback	5	3	That's what I asked you to do, but the narrow end of a wedge should be at the stereogenic atom, and the wide end at the nonstereogenic one.  [Exception: The European convention is that the <i>wide</i> end of a <i>hashed</i> wedge should point at the stereogenic atom!  This convention actually makes more sense from an artistic perspective, but conventions aren't necessarily sensible.]  Now, activate the hashed bond button, and click <i>twice</i> on the same bond.  Note how the bond changes its orientation.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	4	You've pointed the wedge in the correct direction, with the pointed end at the stereogenic C atom, but that's not what I asked you to do.  Reverse it by clicking on it again.
evalFeedback	5	5	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	6		One wedge is almost always sufficient to define the stereochemistry at a stereogenic atom.  (The exception involves Fischer projections; more on that later.)  If you use two wedges to define a stereocenter, you need to be careful how you orient them, or ACE might misinterpret your structure.  For example, suppose you wanted to draw (<I>R</I>)-2-butanol, and you drew the structure in the Marvin window.  Submit this structure. You will see that you get an error message. <p>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the H atom, and drag it above one of the C-C bonds, so it is closer to the OH (either side is OK).  Submit again.
evalFeedback	6	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-2-butanol.  The rule for using one bold and one hashed wedge to indicate a stereocenter is as follows: If the line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms joined to it by wedges bisects the line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms joined to it by regular single bonds, then the configuration can <i>not</i> be assigned.  If the two lines do <i>not</i> bisect one another, then the configuration <i>can</i> be assigned.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	7		On the other hand, sometimes you may use two bold or two hashed wedges to define a stereocenter's configuration.  Again, suppose you drew (<I>R</I>)-2-butanol as in the Marvin window.  Submit the structure. You will see that you get an error message. <P>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the OH group, and drag it below one of the C-C bonds so that the H-C-O angle is close to 180&#176;.  Submit again.
evalFeedback	7	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-2-butanol.  The rule for using two bold or two hashed wedges to indicate a stereocenter is as follows: The line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms connected to it by the wedges <i>should</i> bisect the line connecting the stereocenter and the atoms connected to it by regular single bonds.
evalFeedback	7	2	You dragged the H atom below the horizontal bonds.  You were supposed to drag the OH group.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please follow the instructions.  (Perhaps you dragged the H atom below the horizontal bonds.  You were supposed to drag the OH group.)
qStmt	8		ACE does not read the stereochemical information of Fischer projections. To correctly transfer that information to ACE, at least one wedge has to be drawn to define each stereocenter.  (Of course, this requirement defeats the purpose of Fischer projections, which is to allow absolute configuration to be represented without wedges, but there it is.)  For example, the Fischer projection in the Marvin window represents (<I>R</I>)-glyceraldehyde.  Submit it.
evalFeedback	8	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-glyceraldehyde. When drawing Fischer projections in ACE, use a horizontal bold wedge to define each stereocenter. <P>Now press the Calculate stereo button; it is on the northern toolbar, to the left of the H&plusmn; button, and has a (?) symbol surrounded by two horizontal lines and four vertical lines. Note the configuration of the central C atom. Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the bottom C, drag it to the left, and press the Calculate stereo button again. Now drag the bottom C to the right, and press the Calculate stereo button again. Notice how the configuration changes depending on the angle between the two C-C bonds. When the angle between the two regular bonds, measured through the wedged bond between them, is &ge; 90&deg; (bottom C to the left), ACE assumes the fourth bond to H is next to and pointing opposite to the wedged bond. When the angle is &lt; 90&deg; (bottom C to the right), ACE assumes the fourth bond to H is across from and pointing in the same direction as the wedged bond. These assumptions follow from the tetrahedral nature of the C atom.
evalFeedback	8	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE does <i>not</i> interpret your response as (<i>R</i>)-glyceraldehyde.  Instead, it interprets it as if you had drawn no wedge at all!   <P>Now, turn the central C-OH bond into a Single Up bond (bold wedge), and resubmit.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	9		Double-bond stereochemistry is indicated simply by placing the appropriate groups at appropriate angles.  Inappropriate angles can lead to misinterpreted answers.  For example, suppose you wanted to draw (<I>Z</I>)-2-bromo-2-butene, in which the two CH3 groups were cis to one another, and you drew the structure in the Marvin window.  Submit it.
evalFeedback	9	1	<I>This</I> structure is interpreted as (<I>Z</I>)-2-bromo-2-butene.  The two groups attached to each C(sp2) of an alkene must lay on opposite sides of the line defined by the two C(sp2) atoms for you to be sure that the configuration will be interpreted properly.
evalFeedback	9	2	That's the E isomer.  Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	9	3	You followed the instructions, but ACE interprets your response as having indeterminate stereochemistry, neither E nor Z.  <P>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the CH3 group closest to Br, and drag it down until it is below the line defined by the two C(sp2) atoms.  Submit.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	10		To indicate that a double bond exists as a mixture of E and Z isomers, use a wavy bond from a C(sp2) atom to one of the groups attached to it. For example, right-click (Mac users: control- or option-click) on the bond between a CH3 group and the adjacent C atom, click Bond properties, and choose single up or down (<i>not</i> double cis or trans) from the Type menu. Submit.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  This structure is interpreted as neither the E nor the Z isomer, but as a mixture of both.
evalFeedback	10	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	11		When you draw a structure in Marvin JS, you are drawing it only in 2D. Each atom resides in the plane of the screen, and its z coordinate value is always 0. However, Marvin JS provides a Clean 3D button that converts a 2D structure into its 3D shape, and it provides a 3D Rotate button to then rotate the structure in 3D. The two buttons are adjacent on the northern toolbar. Both have "3D" as part of their icon, but the Clean 3D button has two straight, perpendicular arrows, whereas the 3D Rotate button has a curved arrow. <P>Draw cyclohexane. Press the Add/Remove explicit H button (on the northern toolbar; its icon is H&plusmn;), and then press the Clean 3D button. Now press the 3D Rotate button, and click on the window, hold, and drag. <P>Press Submit at any time.
evalFeedback	11	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	11	2	After you convert a structure to 3D, don't use wedges to indicate stereochemistry.  Wedges are ignored when Marvin JS is in 3D mode.  If you want to use wedges, go back to a 2D representation by pressing the Clean [2D] button, also on the northern toolbar.
qStmt	12		ACE provides you with 3D chair cyclohexane and ethane templates for you to use to draw particular conformations of these compounds, but you need to be careful about how you add substituents to them. For example, click on the first chair cyclohexane ring in the menu bar, and click in the Marvin JS window. Now add two equatorial CH3 groups so that you have the structure in Figure 1. Submit.
evalFeedback	12	1	Please draw 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane according to the instructions.
evalFeedback	12	2	It seems that you have clicked on a ring atom to replace a C atom with another C atom.  When you did so, you removed some hidden markings that help ACE identify which groups are axial and which are equatorial.  Please erase your structure and start over, and be careful not to replace any ring atoms.
evalFeedback	12	3	You followed the instructions, but ACE can't tell that your structure has two equatorial Me groups, because the Me groups that you drew were automatically given a z-coordinate of 0. Choose the 3D Rotate button in the northern toolbar, and twirl the structure until you are looking directly down at the ring, which should look like a regular hexagon. See how one of the CH3 groups is askew from where it should be? <P>Now erase your CH3 groups. Press the Add/Remove explicit H atoms button; it's in the northern toolbar, and its icon is H&plusmn;. The H atoms are placed automatically with the proper 3D coordinates. Now press the C button, and <i>click on</i> two equatorial H atoms that are in a 1,3-relationship. (You may need to rotate the structure again to make clear which H atoms are equatorial and which are axial.) Submit.
evalFeedback	12	4	Now <i>that's</i> a cyclohexane with two equatorial groups! Any atom directly attached to the ring <i>must</i> be added by replacing an H atom. Atoms not directly attached to the ring can be added in any of the usual ways. <P>You have now completed the Marvin JS stereochemistry tutorial.  Feel free to come back and rework it if you need reminders.
qStmt	13		Drawing bridged bicyclic compounds with correct stereochemistry can be difficult. Figure 1 shows a perspective drawing of a bridged bicyclic compound in which the one-carbon bridge on the six-membered ring is pointing in the opposite direction from the CN group. Our eyes can understand the configurations depicted by the perspective drawing, but ACE cannot do. Figure 2 shows two sets of structures that use stereobonds to depict the configurations. In the top row are structures that correctly depict the configurations, and in the bottom row are structures that incorrectly depict the configurations. Press the Calculate stereo button in the northern toolbar (its icon contains a (?) symbol), and verify that all the structures in the top row have the (R,R,R) configuration, whereas that is not true of the structures in the bottom row. Compare structure 5 to structure 1, and structure 6 to structure 3. and review questions 6 and 7 of this tutorial if you don't see why ACE interprets the stereochemistry of structures 5 and 6 in the way that it does. Now delete the structures of the bottom row, and submit.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good! Students often find it easiest to use the second depiction among the correct ones.

qStmt	1		ACE provides three toolbar buttons for drawing mechanisms: the Straight arrow/Reaction group (icon is + above &rarr;), the Electron flow group (icon is a curved arrow starting at a lone pair), and the Rectangle group. They are located toward the bottom of the western toolbar. (If you don't see them, scroll the toolbar down by pressing the down arrow in the lower left-hand corner of the Marvin JS window.) <ul><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the reaction arrow group, a submenu of three buttons appears: the reaction arrow, the resonance arrow, and an equilibrium arrow. Click on a submenu button to make it appear in the main toolbar button. </li><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the electron-flow arrow group, a submenu of two buttons appears: the regular curved arrow (to show the movement of a pair of electrons), and the fishhook or half-headed curved arrow (to show the movement of a single electron). </li><li>If you press and hold or click on the lower right-hand corner of the rectangle group, a submenu of two buttons appears: the rectangle and the ellipse. You will not need to use the ellipse in ACE. </li></ul><p>In the following example, you need to draw electron-flow arrows showing that the N atom uses its lone pair of electrons to make a bond to C, and that the C-Br bond breaks. First, click on the two-electron electron-flow arrow button. Now, click on the N atom on the left so that it magnifies, and then click and hold on the lone pair of the N. Slowly drag the cursor along the line between N and C until the C atom is encircled in blue, and release. A faint dashed line will appear between N and C, and the electron-flow arrow will point to this dashed line. Now click and hold on the C-Br bond, and drag the cursor toward Br until the Br atom is encircled in blue, and release. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Good!  It is not absolutely necessary to magnify the atom before you click and hold on the lone pair, but it is difficult to find the selection zone for the lone pair if you don't. <B>Note</B>: You can alter the arc angle of an electron-flow arrow: press the Select button or the appropriate electron-flow arrow button, mouse over the arrow, click and hold, and drag.
qStmt	2		The reagents required for each step of a mechanism must be included in a box, and the boxes must be connected with reaction arrows. Press the Rectangle button; if a submenu comes up, choose the rectangle, not the ellipse. Draw one rectangle around each of the three structures. The rectangles must not be touching or overlapping. Now, press the button for the reaction arrow; if a submenu comes up, click on the first button. Place the cursor inside the first rectangle, click and hold, drag until the head of the arrow is inside the second rectangle, and release. Now, mouse over a corner or edge midpoint of the second rectangle (they will appear as small squares on the rectangle when it is surrounded by blue lines), click and hold, and drag to a corner or edge midpoint of the third rectangle. It's sometimes a little tricky to place the mouse in just the right spot for the arrow to start, but the advantage of connecting rectangles with the reaction arrows is that if you move a rectangle, the terminus of the reaction arrow will move with it. Feel free to omit one of the rectangles or reaction arrows, and see what happens when you submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Be sure that you are using the correct kind of arrow to connect the rectangles, and be sure that the reaction arrows are connecting the appropriate rectangles.
evalFeedback	2	2	You haven't connected the rectangles in the order in which I asked you to connect them.
evalFeedback	2	3	Good!  Note that the structures in each step of the mechanism may be scattered anywhere on the page; the rectangles and reaction arrows show where they fall in the reaction sequence.  You can move or resize rectangles, too.  To move, press Select, mouse over the rectangle until it is enclosed in blue, click and hold, and drag.  To resize, press Select, mouse over the corner or the midpoint of the side(s) that you want to move, click and hold, and drag.  <P>ACE mechanisms are much easier to draw if you draw <i>first</i> structures and electron-flow arrows, <i>then</i> rectangles, and <i>then</i> reaction (or resonance) arrows to connect the rectangles.
qStmt	3		You should enclose <i>all</i> reagents involved in a particular step in a single box.  The compounds in any box include both the products of the previous step and the starting materials for the next step.  In the following mechanism, draw rectangles around the first structure, the second and third structures, and the fourth structure, and join the boxes with reaction arrows. You may want first to shrink the structures so they all appear in the window; to do so, press the Zoom all button (on the northern toolbar; its icon is a magnifying glass with a &times; in it), or choose the Zoom out button from the Zoom submenu and press it repeatedly.
evalFeedback	3	1	Please follow the instructions.  Be sure that the beginnings and ends of the arrows are either touching the corners or edge midpoints of the appropriate rectangles or reside inside the appropriate rectangles.
evalFeedback	3	2	Oops! The first two boxes contain resonance structures, so you should use a double-headed arrow to connect them. Erase the first reaction arrow, bring up the submenu of the reaction arrow button, click on the two-headed (resonance) arrow button (the second one), and join the first and second boxes with a resonance arrow.
evalFeedback	3	3	You have connected the wrong boxes with a resonance arrow.
evalFeedback	3	4	Good!  ACE understands that the presence of a second starting material in the second box does not change the fact that the electron-flow arrows in the first box lead to a resonance structure in the second box.
qStmt	4		ACE understands that organic chemists may not draw one or more products of a particular mechanistic step. In the following mechanism, EtOH, one of the products from the mechanistic step in box 1, is included in box 2, and Br^-, one of the products from the mechanistic step in box 2, is included in box 3, but you may equally well omit either (if your instructor allows you to do so). Delete EtOH or Br^- or both, as you wish, and submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	4	2	Good!  ACE also understands that starting materials such as Br2 may appear later in a mechanism.
qStmt	5		Drawing electron-flow arrows pointing from a bond to an incipient (newly forming) bond can be tricky when the three atoms involved are collinear. Press the electron-flow arrow button, click and hold on the P=C double bond in the upper box, drag toward the carbonyl C atom until it is encircled in blue, and release. You have now drawn an electron-flow arrow that points to an incipient bond between <i>one</i> of the atoms of the P=C bond and the carbonyl C &#8212; but which one? A faint blue dashed line appears between the connected atoms, but because it overlaps with the P=C double bond, it is impossible to tell whether it is connecting the carbonyl C to the P atom or the C atom of the P=C double bond. <p>The best way to solve this problem is to make the three atoms <i>not</i> collinear. Press the Select button, click-hold, drag around the compound with the P=C bond, and release in order to select it, click and hold on the blue knob above the highlighted compound, and rotate the structure by dragging until the P=C bond is close to vertical. Now it is much easier to see which atoms the electron-flow arrow connects. <p>Now press the electron-flow arrow button again, and click on the leftmost electron-flow arrow repeatedly. Notice how the head of the electron-flow arrow toggles between three positions. These three positions point to between P and the carbonyl C, to between the double-bond C and the carbonyl C, and directly to the carbonyl C. In the first two cases, a faint blue dashed line shows you between which atoms the electron-flow arrow is pointing. You want it to point to between the two C atoms. Submit when you are comfortable that the arrow is connecting the two C atoms.
evalFeedback	5	1	Click again on the electron-flow arrow once or twice to fix it.
evalFeedback	5	2	Good! You can also copy your mechanistic step into the <a href="http://epoch.uky.edu/ace/public/mechmarvin.jsp" target="window3">mechanism calculator</a> and see what ACE makes of your electron-flow arrows.
qStmt	6		When you use the electrons in an X&#8211;Y #sigma or #pi bond to make a new bond between one of the bond atoms (say, X) and a third atom Z, it is important that the electron-flow arrow points from the X&#8211;Y bond to <i><b>between</b></i> atoms X and Z, not <i><b>to</b></i> atom Z. Submit the following incorrectly drawn structure. Then press the electron-flow arrow button, click on the electron-flow arrow in the figure until a faint blue dashed line connects the <i>lower</i> double-bond C to the H^+ ion, and submit again.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good! The reason ACE can't interpret an electron-flow arrow pointing from a bond directly to a third atom is that ACE doesn't know which atom of the bond gets to use the bond electrons to make a new bond to the third atom.
evalFeedback	6	2	If you haven't done so already, press the electron-flow arrow button. Then click on the electron-flow arrow in the figure until it points to a dashed line between the lower C of the &#960; bond and the H^+ atom.
qStmt	7		Sometimes, reagents above or below the arrow will be written as text, not as molecules. You won't be able to use the text in your mechanism; you will have to draw the structure yourself as a molecule. In the following example, delete the reaction arrow; draw one box around the starting materials (CH3Cl and AlCl3) and one around the product (the zwitterion); draw a reaction arrow to connect the first box to the second; draw the appropriate electron-flow arrow from a lone pair of the Cl of CH3Cl to an incipient Cl-Al bond; and submit. Hint: You will need to redraw AlCl3 before you can draw the electron-flow arrow.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!
evalFeedback	7	2	Either your mechanism does not include CH3Cl or AlCl3, or it does not include a correct two-electron electron-flow arrow showing the formation of the Cl-Al bond.
qStmt	8		There is a bug in MarvinJS that makes it impossible to start a two-electron electron-flow arrow at a carbene C. In the figure, the C atom attached to the two Cl atoms is a carbene, with a lone pair and an empty orbital. (To make a C atom into a carbene, right- or control-click on the C atom, and, from the <b>Radical</b> menu, choose "divalent singlet".) First, draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the alkene &#960; bond to the carbene C, so there is a dashed line connecting one of the alkene C atoms and the carbene C. Now, ordinarily, you would draw another two-electron electron-flow arrow from the carbene C lone pair to the other alkene C. However, MarvinJS won't let you draw the latter two-electron arrow. As a work-around, draw two one-electron arrows, one from each electron of the carbene, both pointing to the other alkene C, so your drawing has three electron-flow arrows altogether. Submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!
evalFeedback	8	2	Please follow the instructions.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS radical mechanisms tutorial
qStmt	1		In a free-radical mechanism, we use one-electron electron-flow arrows to draw the movement of electrons. In the following example, you will draw the arrows for a radical atom abstraction step. First, click on the Zoom all button (on the northern toolbar; its icon is a magnifying glass with an &times; in it) to make the entire mechanism fit on the canvas. Now, click on the lower right corner of the electron-flow arrow button, and click on the one-electron (half-headed or fishhook) arrow button of the submenu. Click on either O atom in box 1, click and hold on one of its electrons (the unpaired electron is a good choice), drag the cursor to H until it is encircled in blue and a faint dashed line connects it with the O atom, and release. Next, click and hold on the C-H bond, drag to the O atom from which the first electron-flow arrow originated until it is encircled in blue, and release. (The new arrow should point to the middle of the faint dashed line connecting O and H; if instead it points to a the middle of a faint dashed line connecting O and C, click on the arrow until it points to the desired place.)<blockquote>Because you began this second electron-flow arrow at a bond, Marvin JS doesn't have any way of knowing which end of the bond (C or H) you want to connect to the O atom. In this example, you want the arrow to connect the H and the O. If, however, you see a dashed line connecting the C and the O, then the arrow is connecting the C and the O. Simply click on the arrow once or twice until it connects the H and the O.</blockquote>Next, click and hold on the C-H bond, drag to the C, and release. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Good! The reaction between a free radical and a nonradical almost always involves three one-electron electron-flow arrows. By the way, if you need more room to draw your mechanism, click-hold the lower right corner of the drawing canvas, and drag.
qStmt	2		Now draw the electron-flow arrows for a radical addition to a &#960; bond. Choose the one-electron electron-flow arrow from the pulldown menu of the electron-flow arrow button. In box 1, click on C&bull;, click and hold on its electron, drag to the CH2 group until its letter C is encircled in blue, and release. You should see a faint gray dashed line connecting the C&bull; and CH2 groups. Next, click and hold on the C=C bond, drag to the C&bull; until it is encircled in blue, and release. Make sure that the new arrow points to the gray dashed line connecting the C&bull; and CH2 groups; if it doesn't, click on the arrow until it does. Finally, click and hold on the C=C bond, drag to the northeast until the C attached to Ph is encircled in blue, and release. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Good! If you want to practice drawing electron-flow arrows and seeing what ACE calculates as the products of your electron-flow arrows, visit ACE's <a href="http://epoch.uky.edu/ace/public/mechmarvin.jsp" target="window3">mechanism calculator</a>.
qStmt	3		Most of the mechanisms involving free radicals that you will draw are chain mechanisms. A chain mechanism has three parts: initiation, propagation, and termination. ACE will not ask you to draw the termination part of a mechanism. The initiation part of a mechanism is usually one or two steps; the propagation part can be any number of steps, and is often only two steps. A free radical chain mechanism has stoichiometric starting materials and products, and it often has a catalyst, though not always.<p>The initiation part of the mechanism involves the conversion of one of the stoichiometric starting materials into a free radical. In the reaction shown in Figure 1, no chemical initiator is added to the reaction to convert one of the stoichiometric starting materials into a free radical, but light causes the weakest bond in the reaction mixture, the C&#8211;Br bond, to undergo #sigma-bond homolysis. Draw the products of initiation and the electron-flow arrows that show the homolytic cleavage of the C-Br bond.
evalFeedback	3	1	Don't change the structure of the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	2	What are the products of #sigma-bond homolysis of the C-Br bond?
evalFeedback	3	4	Good! Two radicals are produced. The alkyl radical will be the starting point for the propagation part of the mechanism.
qStmt	4		The propagation part of a free radical chain mechanism has the following characteristics. <ol><li>Every propagation step involves an odd-electron compound being converted to a new odd-electron compound.</li><li>The initiation part of the mechanism produces the odd-electron compound used in the first propagation step.</li><li>The last propagation step produces the odd-electron compound that is used in the first propagation step.</li><li>Every stoichiometric starting material appears in the propagation, <i>even though</i> it may also appear in the initiation.</li><li>Every product of the mechanism is produced in the propagation.</li><li>If an initiator is present, its parts do not appear int he propagation.</li></ol>

<p>The reaction shown in Figure 1 is an addition reaction, with the mechanism appearing in Figure 2. You've already drawn the initiation part of the mechanism, which is now the first step of the mechanism shown here. The remaining steps of the mechanism constitute the propagation part of the mechanism. Note a few things about the way it has been drawn.<ol><li>The propagation part of this mechanism has just two steps.</li><li>The second (last) step of the propagation produces the radical produced in the initation, and this radical is already present in the first step of the propagation, so there is a reaction arrow pointing from the second (last) step of the propagation back to the first step of the propagation!</li><li>Also produced in the last step of the propagation is the one product of this reaction. This product is drawn in its own box, and the arrow that points to this box branches off the midpoint of the arrow that points from the second (last) step of the propagation back to the first step of the propagation.</li><li>Reaction arrows can start and end either on corners and edges or in the middle of boxes.</li></ol>

<p>Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Don't change the structure of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	2	Don't change the product of the reaction.
evalFeedback	4	4	Continue to the next example.
qStmt	5		Figure 2 shows the initiation and propagation parts of the mechanism of the reaction in Figure 1. Arrange the mechanism in boxes and with reaction arrows so that ACE will be able to interpret it properly. Note that one of your two stoichiometric starting materials (cyclopentane and Br2) appears twice: once in the initiation, and once in the last step of the propagation. Both the last step of initiation (in this mechanism, the initiation is just a single step) and the last step of the propagation produce the same radical, so both these steps point to the same box, which should contain that radical.
evalFeedback	5	1	Your mechanism must include both of the starting materials of the reaction.
evalFeedback	5	2	The organic product of the reaction must appear in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	5	3	Don't use a resonance arrow to connect two boxes that do not contain resonance structures.  If you want two boxes to point to one another, you have to use two reaction arrows.  Remember that a reaction arrow can link any edge midpoint or corner of one rectangle to any edge midpoint or corner of the other.
evalFeedback	5	4	You have drawn a linear mechanism, not a chain one.  Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step, and this box has two reaction arrows pointing to it.
evalFeedback	5	5	Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step, and this box has two reaction arrows pointing to it.
evalFeedback	5	6	Although you have drawn a mechanism with a cyclic topology, you have not drawn boxes and arrows that are correct for this mechanism.  Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step.  Your mechanism should have three boxes and three reaction arrows.  Two boxes should be pointing to one, which should point back at one of the two.
evalFeedback	5	7	Your mechanism does not show the initiation step, in which Br2 is converted to 2Br&middot;.
evalFeedback	5	8	Good!  A reaction with two propagation steps contains two boxes in the cyclic part, which point to one another.  Again, ACE will not expect you to draw termination steps as part of a free-radical chain mechanism.  <P>You have now completed the mechanism tutorial.  Good luck!
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS multistep synthesis tutorial
qStmt	1		A multistep synthesis question consists of a target of the synthesis and a series of starting materials and intermediates enclosed in boxes connected by linear arrows.  In addition, a box (except the one containing the target) may contain a number, and a user should choose reaction conditions to associate with each number.  In the following example, press the Text button (bottom of the western toolbar; its icon is a T), and click inside the first box. In the dialog box that pops up, enter the number 1, and press Ok. Next, click on <b>Add first reaction condition</b> (underneath the Marvin window), and click on <b>[simply mix]</b> to change this set of reaction conditions. In the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>NaNO2, aq. HCl</b>. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	You followed the instructions, but NaNO2 and aq. HCl do not react with benzene, and ACE knows that.  Click on <b>NaNO2, aq. HCl</b>, and then, in the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>Br2, FeBr3</b>.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	2	You followed the instructions, but, although Br2 and FeBr3 react with benzene, they don't add an NO2 group, and ACE knows that.  Now click on <b>Br2, FeBr3</b>, and then, in the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>HNO3</b>.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	3	Good!
evalFeedback	1	4	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		One of the reaction conditions that is always available to you is <b>[simply mix]</b>.  You will want to use this reaction condition when you treat one compound with a reagent to make it reactive, and then add another compound.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Good!  You could also omit adding reaction condition 2 or the number <b>2</b> in the second box or both.  If ACE cannot find a reaction condition that corresponds to a box, or if a box does not contain a number, ACE assumes that the reaction condition for that box is <b>[simply mix]</b>.
qStmt	3		You can draw a convergent synthesis, in which you combine two compounds that must both be prepared.  Suppose you are asked to prepare the target compound in the rightmost box from benzene and propionic acid (CH3CH2CO2H).  Although the drawn synthesis now works as written, it does not use the correct starting materials.  See what happens when you submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	One of the starting materials of this synthesis does not have the characteristics of a permissible starting material.  You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that chlorobenzene is not a permissible starting material.  Follow these instructions: <ol><li>Draw benzene to the left of the left-hand box.  (To move the existing structures to the right to make room for benzene, press the middle magnifying glass, then select everything, click and hold on something green, drag to the right, and release.)<li>Box benzene. <li>Place a 2 in the box with benzene.   <li>Draw an arrow from the new box to the middle box.  <li>Click <b>Insert after here</b> on line 1 to add a line for reaction condition 2.  <li>Choose <b>Electrophilic halogen</b> &rarr; <b>Cl2, FeCl3</b> for reaction condition 2.  <li>Submit.</ol>
evalFeedback	3	2	One of the starting materials of this synthesis does not have the characteristics of a permissible starting material. You again followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that CH3CH2COCl is not a permissible starting material, either. Follow these instructions: <ol><li>Press <b>Select</b>, double-click on CH3CH2COCl, press control-C (Mac users: command-C) to copy it, press control-V (Mac users: command-V) to paste it, click and hold on something green, drag it under (not in) the benzene-containing box, release, and click anywhere to unselect the structure. <li>Change the Cl of the newly pasted compound to OH. <li>Box CH3CH2CO2H. <li>Draw an arrow from the new box to the middle one.  You should now have four boxes, with two of the boxes pointing to the one in the middle. <li>Place a 3 in the new box. <li>Add a line for reaction condition 3. <li>Choose <b>Electrophilic main group (not halogen)</b> &rarr; <b>SOCl2</b> for reaction condition 3.  <li>Submit.</ol>
evalFeedback	3	3	Good!  A convergent synthesis can have any number of branches of any length, though it is very rare that you will ever see more than two arrows pointing to a single box.  <i>Always</i> read carefully what starting materials you may use for your synthesis.  Also, note that the numbers in the boxes need not be in any particular order.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw compounds and choose reaction conditions according to the instructions.
qStmt	4		ACE will alert you if your synthesis produces the wrong compound or stereoisomer.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	4	1	You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that H2, Lindlar cat. will make the cis alkene, not the trans alkene. Click on <b>H2, Lindlar cat.</b> and choose <b>Reduction</b> &rarr; <b>Li (2 equiv), liq. NH3, <i>t</i>-BuOH</b> instead. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	2	The new set of reaction conditions produces the trans alkene.  Note that it was not necessary to assign the reaction condition <b>[simply mix]</b> to box 2, but you could do so if you wanted.
qStmt	5		ACE may alert you if your synthesis produces not only the compound you indicate, but also other diastereomers or compounds.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	5	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	5	2	You followed the instructions, but the reaction condition that you were directed to choose produced not only the diastereomer shown, but another as well.  (The calculated products also include both enantiomeric forms.)  Click on <b>H2O, conc. H2SO4</b>, choose <b>Addition</b> &rarr; <b>BH3 or (R)2BH; then H2O2, aq. NaOH</b>, and submit.
evalFeedback	5	3	The new reaction condition is diastereoselective.  ACE is also capable of determining whether your synthesis produces only a single enantiomer of the target compound.
qStmt	6		ACE may alert you if you go the trouble of preparing a compound that is a permissible starting material.  In the following example, you were asked to produce the target alkene from <b>any alkyne</b> and any other compound containing <b>no more than three contiguous C atoms</b>.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	6	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	6	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that the compounds in boxes 2 and 3 are alkynes, which makes them permissible starting materials, so you should not have gone to the trouble of preparing them.  Delete boxes 1 and 2 and their contents, and submit again.  (You don't need to delete reaction condition 1; if ACE doesn't find a box with the number of a reaction condition, it will ignore that reaction condition.  However, if it really bugs you to have a useless reaction condition 1, you can press the <b>Remove</b> link next to it.  Note, however, that reaction condition 2 is then renumbered as reaction condition 1, and you will need to change the number in the corresponding box from 2 to 1.  Press the Text button on the Marvin toolbar, click on 2, highlight it, and type 1.)
evalFeedback	6	3	Good.  Because the permissible starting materials were defined as "any alkyne and any other compound containing no more than three contiguous C atoms," the synthesis you have now is correct.  If they had been defined as "any compound containing no more than three contiguous C atoms," then the original synthesis would have been correct.
qStmt	7		ACE understands that organic chemists don't pay much attention to stoichiometry.  ACE will automatically incorporate two equivalents of a reagent if that is its normal pattern of reactivity; you don't need to (shouldn't) draw the reagent twice.  In the following example, draw CH3Li alongside the ester in box 1, and submit.  (You don't need to indicate a particular reaction condition, because if you indicate none, ACE will apply "[simply mix]".)
evalFeedback	7	2	Good.  You can see that two CH3 groups are incorporated into the product, even though you only drew one equivalent of CH3Li in the first box.  You can also see that ACE assumes that the product you draw in the subsequent box is the product that is obtained after ordinary aqueous workup.<p>You have reached the end of the tutorial.</p>
qStmt	8		One aspect of synthesis questions that can be confusing is when you need to draw intermediates.  For example, in the following reaction, you want to remove an H atom from the #a-carbon of the ketone and then do a substitution reaction to add the CH3 group to it.  To do this reaction, you need to add a base.  I've chosen LDA for you as your base.  Go ahead and submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	You followed the instructions, but ACE marked this answer as wrong, because applying LDA to a ketone to generate the corresponding enolate needs to be done in a step <i>separate</i> from the addition of the CH3I.  It <i>is</i> possible to generate the enolate in the <i>presence</i> of the CH3I, but in that case, you would use a different base.  Click on <b>LDA (LiN(i-Pr)2)</b>, choose <b>Basic &rarr; NaO-<i>t</i>-Bu (&ge; 1 equiv.), #heat</b>, and submit again.
evalFeedback	8	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE marked this answer as wrong, because when you apply a moderate base to a ketone, polyalkylation occurs.  To draw the monoalkylation, first place a negative charge on the C of cyclohexanone that is adjacent to the carbonyl C.  Then draw cyclohexanone to the left of the first box, box it, and draw an arrow from that box to the one containing the anion.  Move the <b>1</b> from the second box to the first one, change the reaction condition back to <b>LDA (LiN(i-Pr)2)</b>, and submit again.
evalFeedback	8	3	Good!  In general, it's better to generate the anion in one step and then add the electrophile in the next step, although there are exceptions (carbonyl poly-#a-alkylation, Michael reaction) to this rule.
qStmt	9		ACE will sometimes object if you draw a reagent in MarvinSketch when that reagent is available from the reagent window. For example, see what happens when you submit the following reaction. <p>Afterwards, add the reaction condition <b>AlCl3</b> from the reagent menu (you can find it in the  <b>Acidic</b> section), delete the AlCl3 structure from box 1, add the number <b>1</b> to box 1, and resubmit.
evalFeedback	9	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	9	2	Good!  Now ACE is happy with your response.  Most of the compounds that ACE will not accept from MarvinSketch are small inorganic reagents such as H2, PCl3, and Br2, although 1,2-ethanediol (HOCH2CH2OH) is in the list as well.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinJS SRN1 tutorial
qStmt	1		Drawing reactions involving electron transfer can be challenging. There are two electron transfer cases: those in which the electron is transferred into a #sigma* orbital, and those in which it is transferred into a #pi* orbital. In the following example of the first case, P transfers an electron into the #sigma* orbital associated with the C-Br bond. First, select the starting materials, use your keyboard to copy them, use your keyboard to paste them, click and hold one of the selected atoms, and drag the selection into the products box. Now, draw a one-electron arrow from the starting material P <i>directly</i> to the starting material Br, the more electronegative of the two atoms of the C-Br bond, in the following way:
<ol><li>Choose the one-electron arrow from the western toolbar.
</li><li>Click on the P atom.
</li><li>Click-hold on one of the electrons of the P lone pair, drag to the Br atom, and release.
</li><li>Click on the arrow.
</li></ol>
Now, right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the product Br, choose Atom properties, enter a charge of -1 and choose monovalent from the Radical menu, and press OK. [Marvin JS may highlight in red the Br atom to indicate a valence error; if it does, ignore it, it's a bug.] Then right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the product P, choose Atom properties, enter a charge of 1 and choose monovalent from the Radical menu, and press OK. [Marvin JS may add two implicit H atoms to your P radical cation; if it does, ignore it, it's a bug. Also, the + charge that you place on P may look like a &#8211; charge if the scale is a little smaller than standard.] Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	The electron donor, P, should have its charge increased by 1 and should become a radical.
evalFeedback	1	2	The electron recipient, Br, should have its charge decreased by 1 and should become a radical.
evalFeedback	1	3	A one-electron arrow should point directly from P to Br.
evalFeedback	1	4	Good!
qStmt	2		In the following example of electron transfer to a #pi* orbital, Na transfers an electron into the #pi* orbital associated with the C=O bond. First, copy the starting materials into the product box. Next, draw a <i>one-electron</i> arrow from Na <i>directly</i> to C, the <i>less</i> electronegative of the two atoms of the #pi bond, in this way:
<ol><li>Choose the one-electron arrow from the western toolbar.
</li><li>Click on the Na atom.
</li><li>Click-hold on the electron of Na, drag to the carbonyl C atom, and release.
</li><li>Click on the arrow.
</li></ol>
Next, draw a <i>two-electron</i> arrow from the C=O #pi bond to O, the <i>more</i> electronegative of the two atoms of the #pi bond. Now, moving to the products, change the C=O double bond to a single bond; change the charge of O to -1; right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the former carbonyl C, choose Atom properties, choose monovalent from the Radical menu, and press Ok; and right-click (Mac users: control-click) on Na, choose Atom properties, enter a charge of 1 and choose none from the Radical menu, and press Ok. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	The electron donor, Na&middot;, should have its charge increased by 1 and should have its radical status turned off.
evalFeedback	2	2	The electron recipient, C, should become a radical, the O atom should have its formal charge decreased by 1, and the order of the C-O bond should decrease by 1.
evalFeedback	2	3	A one-electron arrow should point directly from Na to the carbonyl C, and a two-electron arrow should point from the C=O #pi bond to O.
evalFeedback	2	4	Good!
qStmt	3		After an electron is transferred into a #sigma* orbital, the next step is often cleavage of the bond associated with that orbital. Draw a one-electron arrow from the C-Br bond to the Br atom and another one-electron arrow from the C-Br bond to the C atom. Then draw the two products of the reaction, (CH3)3C&middot; and Br^-. [Marvin JS may highlight the starting Br atom for a valence error; if it does, ignore it, it's a bug.] Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	The Br atom leaves with a pair of electrons and a negative charge to become Br^-.
evalFeedback	3	2	The C-Br bond breaks homolytically, so the C atom gets one unshared electron.
evalFeedback	3	3	One-electron arrows should point from the C-Br bond to each of the two atoms in the bond.
evalFeedback	3	4	Good!
qStmt	4		An electron-sufficient nucleophile will often make a bond to a radical in an SRN1 mechanism. In the following example, copy the starting materials into the product window. In the starting materials window, draw a one-electron arrow from P to <i>between</i> P and the C radical, and draw another one-electron arrow from the C radical to <i>between</i> the C radical and P. Then, in the product window, join the C radical and P with a single bond, change the C radical property to none, and change the P radical property to monovalent. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	In the product, the P atom becomes a monovalent radical, but its formal charge remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	4	2	One-electron arrows should point from P to between P and C&middot; and from C&middot; to between P and C&middot;.
evalFeedback	4	3	Good!  You now have completed the steps necessary to draw an S<sub>RN</sub>1 mechanism.  Feel free to review these last few exercises when you encounter S<sub>RN</sub>1 mechanisms in the future.

evalFeedback	1	1	Good.  Note how the magnitude and direction of the vector appears in the upper left corner as you are drawing the vector and after you have finished.
evalFeedback	1	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		From the pulldown menu below the image, choose <b>Select existing</b>. Click and hold on the vector, drag the cursor, and release to move the vector. Now shift-click and hold on the vector, drag the cursor, and release to make a copy of the vector. Click near one of the vectors; a blue box will appear around it. Choose <b>Invert</b> from the second pulldown menu. Now select the original, uninverted vector, and press the backspace (delete) key on your keyboard. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Good.  You can also delete a selected vector by choosing <b>Delete</b> from the pulldown menu.  Now press <b>Start over</b>, and see how the original vector picture reappears.

qStmt	1		Draw methane (CH4).  Click on the C button and then click on the drawing area to draw methane. Note how the H atoms are automatically added to bring the C valence up to 4. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Correct!
evalFeedback	1	2	No, that's not methane (CH4).  Try again.
qStmt	2		Draw ethane (CH3-CH3). Press the C button and click in the window to redraw methane (CH4). Now click on the Bond button (the first button on the bottom toolbar), place the cursor over the C atom (you should see the C atom highlighted in green), click and hold, drag the cursor in any direction until the green highlighting disappears and a faint line sprouts from the formerly highlighted C atom, and release. You should now have CH3-CH3. Note how the number of H atoms on the original C atom changes automatically to give it a correct valence. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Correct!
evalFeedback	2	2	That's not ethane (CH3-CH3).  Try again.
qStmt	3		Redraw ethane (CH3-CH3) by clicking on the Bond button and then clicking in the window. Now add more carbons to your structure by clicking on existing C atoms (just click on them, no need to click-hold and drag) until you have drawn 2-methylbutane, the structure shown in the figure. Note that the middle C atoms no longer show C or H labels; this representation of a molecule, in which vertices represent C atoms, and each C atom is assumed to have enough H atoms to bring its valence to 4, is called a <b>skeletal</b> drawing.  Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!
evalFeedback	3	2	That's not 2-methylbutane.  Your answer should have a chain of four C atoms with one additional C atom attached to one of the middle C atoms of the chain.  Try again.
qStmt	4		Press the bond tool button, place the cursor over the bond between the two rightmost C atoms of the structure in the Marvin window (the bond will be highlighted in green), and click once to change it to a double bond. You should now have the structure shown in Figure 2, 3-methyl-1-butene. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!
evalFeedback	4	2	You clicked on the wrong C-C bond.  Press the Bond tool, click on the double bond again to remove it, and try again.
evalFeedback	4	3	That's not 3-methyl-1-butene.  Try again.
qStmt	5		Press the bond tool button, place the cursor over the rightmost bond in the structure in the Marvin window (the bond will be highlighted in green), and double-click on the bond to change it to a triple bond. You should now have the structure shown in Figure 2, 3-methyl-1-butyne.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Correct.
evalFeedback	5	2	That's not 3-methyl-1-butyne.  Try again.
qStmt	6		Click on the O button, and then click on C^1, the leftmost C atom, to change it into an OH group. You should now have 2-butanol, the structure shown in Figure 2. (Note how the valence of the O atom is automatically satisfied by the addition of an H atom.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	6	1	Right!  To see the lone pairs on the O atom, choose View &rarr; Misc &rarr; Lone Pairs.
evalFeedback	6	2	That's not 2-butanol.  Try again.
qStmt	7		Click on the O button, click and hold on C^1, the uppermost C atom, drag until the blue circle becomes a pink circle, and release to add another OH group. You should have 1,2-butanediol, the structure shown in Figure 2.  Submit.
evalFeedback	7	1	Right!
evalFeedback	7	2	That's not 1,2-butanediol.  Try again.
qStmt	8		Press the O button.  Click and hold on C^1 (the uppermost C atom), drag and release to add an OH group, and then click on the new C-O bond to turn it into a C=O double bond. You should now have 2-hydroxybutanal, the structure shown in Figure 2. (Again, note how the H atom is automatically removed from O when the single bond is changed to a double bond.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	Right!
evalFeedback	8	2	You clicked on the wrong C-O bond.  Press the Bond tool, and click once on the C=O double bond to convert it back to a single bond.  Then convert the other C-O bond to a C=O bond.
evalFeedback	8	3	That's not 2-hydroxybutanal.  Try again.
qStmt	9		Click on the benzene button (the six-membered ring with three alternating double bonds), and click in the drawing area near the OH group to add a benzene ring near the OH group.  Now click on the bond button, click and hold on the O atom (from the OH group), drag the cursor to any one of the C atoms of the benzene ring, and release. You should have now 2-phenoxybutanal, the structure shown in Figure 2.  (Again, note how the valence of the O atom is automatically corrected.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  Now, to see all the H atoms in condensed format, from the View menu, choose Hydrogens &rarr; All.  To see all the H atoms drawn out explicitly, from the Edit menu, choose Add &rarr; Explicit H Atoms.
evalFeedback	9	2	That's not 2-phenoxybutanal.  Try again.
qStmt	10		Draw four C atoms in a zigzag chain (butane). Now click on the bond connecting the middle C atoms to convert it into a double bond. You will now have <i>trans</i>-2-butene, the structure shown in Figure 1.  To convert it into <i>cis</i>-2-butene, the structure shown in Figure 2, press the Select button (upper leftmost), click and hold on one of the terminal C atoms, and drag it so that the four C atoms form a U shape instead of a zigzag shape.  Submit.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  If you have not already learned about stereoisomerism in alkenes (you would know it if you have), this exercise will not be very meaningful to you.  But remember to review this exercise when you reach that subject.
evalFeedback	10	2	You've drawn the trans isomer.  The four C atoms should be in a U shape, not a zigzag shape.
evalFeedback	10	3	That's not the correct structure.  Try again.
qStmt	11		Draw sodium ethoxide. First draw ethanol (CH3CH2OH): click on the bond tool, click on the canvas to draw CH3-CH3, click on the O button, click-and-hold on one of the C atoms (it should be highlighted in green), drag in any direction until a faint line sprouts from the C atom, and release. Now type Na. Click and hold on the O atom of the OH group (it should be highlighted in green), drag in any direction until a faint line sprouts from the O atom, and release. Submit.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  You can bring up almost any element this way, or you can bring up any element by pressing the More button and clicking on the appropriate element.  You can also bring up the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium, by typing D or T, respectively.  They appear in molecules as <sup>2</sup>H or <sup>3</sup>H, respectively.
evalFeedback	11	2	That's not sodium ethoxide (CH3CH2ONa).  Try again.
qStmt	12		Click on the structure in the Figure, select <i>all</i> of the gobbledygook that appears in the new window [best to type the appropriate keystroke for Select All on your computer (Mac users: command-A)], copy the selected text, and close the window. Press the Paste button in the MarvinSketch toolbar, and submit.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  Alternatively, you can press the Launch MarvinView link, then right-click (Mac users: control-click) on the structure, and choose Edit &rarr; Copy. <p>You can also copy a structure already in your Marvin window.  Press the Select button, double-click on the structure (or draw a loop or box around it), and press the Copy button.  Then press the Paste button, and click somewhere in the window to paste a copy of the structure in the window.  (If the window is empty, you don't need to click; the structure will appear automatically.)
evalFeedback	12	2	No, that's not right.  Try again.
qStmt	13		Draw terephthalic acid (Figure 1). First draw the benzene ring with the appropriate tool.  (Use the one with three double bonds!) To add the first CO2H group, click on the bond button, and click on one of the C atoms of the benzene ring to add a CH3 group. Now type CO^2H. The cursor should have a little CO2H symbol next to it.  Click on the new CH3 group. It should change to a CO2H group. To add the second CO2H group, choose Insert &rarr; Groups, and, in sequence, click on the small circles next to C, CO, and CO^2.  Click on CO^2H and press Close. Click on the C atom of the ring that is opposite to the one that bears the CO2H group.  (The CO2H group on the left will automatically turn around to point the bond to the C.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good!  Clicking on a terminal atom in a structure will change that atom into the group.  Clicking on an internal atom in a structure will attach the group to that atom.<p>You can add many different groups &#8212; OMe, CO2Me, Ph, iPr, etc. &#8212; either by typing the name of the group or by going to the Insert &rarr; Group menu.  Also, if you encounter an unfamiliar group, you can see what it represents by right-clicking (Mac users: control- or option-click) on it and choosing Expand Group.
<p><b>Note:</b> A bug in MarvinSketch deactivates the keyboard after you go to the Insert menu.
evalFeedback	13	2	Oops!  You drew a six-membered ring with no double bonds (a cyclohexane ring).  You need a six-membered ring with three alternating double bonds (a benzene ring).
evalFeedback	13	3	No, that's not terephthalic acid.  Try again.
qStmt	14		A handful of common organic groups have abbreviations that are identical to those of elements. In organic chemistry, Ac usually means acetyl, CH3C(=O), not the element actinium; Pr usually means propyl, CH3CH2CH2, not the element praseodymium; and Am usually means amyl, an old-fashioned synonym for pentyl, not the element americium. In MarvinSketch, the abbreviations for acetyl and actinium are differentiated by case: that it, you would type "Ac" to bring up an actinium atom and "ac" to bring up an acetyl group. The same holds for propyl/praseodymium and amyl/americium. In the following example, press the Select button, mouse over the CH3 group, type "ac" to convert it to an acetyl group (abbreviated as Ac), and submit.
evalFeedback	14	1	Good! You can tell whether an Ac on the canvas represents acetyl or actinium from its color: acetyl Ac is black, whereas actinium Ac is brick-red. You can also tell by selecting the Ac symbol and then choosing Structure &rarr; Group; if the Expand Groups menu option is activated, then the Ac represents acetyl; if not, it represents actinium. When you are drawing a structure, and you want to insert an acetyl Ac group, an alternative to typing "ac" is to choose Insert &rarr; Groups, click on the node next to A, then on the node next to Ac, then on Ac, then press <b>Close</b>, then click on the Marvin window again.
evalFeedback	14	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	15		Use the second, third, and fourth buttons on the bottom toolbar to draw bonds that indicate stereochemistry.  Click on the third button on the bottom toolbar, and click on the C-NH2 bond.  Click on the second button on the bottom toolbar, and click on the C-Cl bond.  Click on the fourth button on the bottom toolbar, and click on the C-OH bond.  You should have the structure shown in Fig. 2.  Submit.
evalFeedback	15	1	Right!  You can also change the type of an existing bond by right-clicking (Mac users: control- or option-click) on it and choosing Type &rarr; the appropriate bond.  <P>You may want to work the Stereochemistry Tutorial to learn more about how to indicate stereochemistry in Marvin and how Marvin interprets stereochemistry in drawings.
evalFeedback	15	2	One of your bond wedges is oriented in the wrong direction.  All should have their narrow end at the C.  Click on the button that represents the type of bond that is reversed, and click on the existing wedge to reverse its direction.
evalFeedback	15	3	Please make all three vertical bonds into the appropriate types.
evalFeedback	15	4	Please make sure you've drawn the correct structure.
qStmt	16		Draw ^+CH2-CH2&bull; (Figure 1).  First draw ethane (CH3-CH3) by pressing the Bond button and clicking in the window.  Now press the + button and click on one of the C atoms.  (Clicking on any atom with the + (or -) button will increase (or decrease) its charge.)  Now convert the other C atom to a radical by pressing the Rad button and clicking on the other C.  You should have the structure shown in Figure 1.  Submit.
evalFeedback	16	1	Right!  You've seen the most essential the features of MarvinSketch, and you're now ready to tackle the problems.  If you ever need to do anything in MarvinSketch that you don't know how to do, press the Help button above and see the Introduction to MarvinSketch.  When you begin to tackle stereochemistry problems, be sure to work the MarvinSketch stereochemistry tutorial to learn some of the intricacies of how MarvinSketch interprets the stereochemistry of your drawings.
evalFeedback	16	2	That's not the right answer.  Try again.
qStmt	17		Occasionally, a question may show a toolbar button for a coordinate bond to the immediate right of the wavy bond button.  In ACE, the only purpose of the coordinate bond is to show hydrogen-bonding interactions.  The coordinate bond should point from the lone-pair-bearing atom to the H atom.  Draw two coordinate bonds between the carbonyl O atom of each carboxylic acid and the H atom of the other.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good.
evalFeedback	17	2	No.  Make sure that you have used the coordinate bond tool to draw the requisite C=O&rarr;H-O coordinate bonds.
qStmt	18		Sometimes you will need to resize a drawing, and sometimes you will need to resize the canvas. To see all of the cholesterol molecules in the MarvinSketch window, press the Autoscale button (top toolbar, middle magnifying glass, shows 100 in the middle). To resize the structures, press the Zoom in and Zoom out buttons. To create a larger canvas for editing, choose View &rarr; Sketcher window and resize the popup window to fill your whole screen. Whatever changes you make in the sketcher window will appear in the applet still embedded in the Web page. When you have finished playing around, submit.
evalFeedback	18	1	Good!
evalFeedback	18	2	No, that's not right.  Try again.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch stereochemistry tutorial
qStmt	1		Press the third button on the bottom toolbar (the bold wedge), and click on the C-O bond to change it to a bold wedge.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good.
evalFeedback	1	2	The wide end of the wedge should point toward O.   Press the third button on the bottom toolbar (the bold wedge), and click on the C-OH bond to change the direction of the wedge.
evalFeedback	1	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		The type of bond (bold, hashed, or wavy) is easily changed.  Press the second button on the bottom toolbar (the hashed wedge), and click on the C-O bond to change it to a hashed wedge.  Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good.
evalFeedback	2	2	The wide end of the wedge should point toward O.   Press the second button on the bottom toolbar (the hashed wedge), and click on the C-OH bond to change the direction of the wedge.
evalFeedback	2	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	3		There's another way to change the nature of the bond.  Right-click (Mac users: control- or option-click) on the C-O bond and choose Type &rarr; Single Up or Down.  The bold wedge should change to a wavy bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  Use the wavy bond to indicate a mixture of configurations at a particular stereocenter.  If the configuration is unknown or unspecified, just use a regular single bond.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	4		You can also draw a stereo bond from scratch.  Press the second button on the bottom toolbar (the hashed wedge), and click on the O button or type O.  Now add O atoms to positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the molecule in the window until you have drawn the compound in Figure 2.  All the bonds you draw now are hashed wedges.  Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  To convert a stereobond back to a regular bond, click the first button on the bottom toolbar, and click on the bond.  Or you can right-click (Mac users: control- or option-click) on the bond and choose Type &rarr; Single. Or you can type 1 and click on the bond.  The possibilities are almost endless!
evalFeedback	4	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	5		Be careful in which direction your wedges point.  The North American convention is for the pointed end of a wedge (bold, hashed, or squiggly) to be at the stereogenic atom, but Marvin sometimes puts the wedge in the wrong direction.  Press the bold-wedge button, and click <i>twice</i> on the bond between the central N and the C atom to its right.  Note how the pointed end of the wedge is at N, not at the stereogenic C atom.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good.  The pointed end of the wedge is correctly (according to North American convention) at the stereogenic atom.  Even if you point the wide end of a wedge toward the stereogenic atom, ACE is programmed to understand what you mean -- but your instructor might not be so programmed, so don't get into the habit!
evalFeedback	5	2	You've put the wide end of the hashed wedge at the stereogenic atom, which is the correct direction according to European convention, but that's not what you were asked to do.  Please click again on the hashed bond to reverse its direction.
evalFeedback	5	3	That's what I asked you to do, but the pointed end of a wedge should be at the stereogenic atom, and the wide end at the nonstereogenic one.  [Exception: The European convention is that the <i>wide</i> end of a <i>hashed</i> wedge should point at the stereogenic atom!  This convention actually makes more sense from an artistic perspective, but conventions aren't necessarily sensible.]  Now, press the hashed-bond button, and click <i>once</i> on the same bond.  Note how the pointed end of the wedge changes direction.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	4	You've pointed the wedge in the correct direction, with the pointed end at the stereogenic C atom, but that's not what I asked you to do.  Reverse it by clicking on it again with the bold-bond tool.
evalFeedback	5	5	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	6		One wedge is almost always sufficient to define the stereochemistry at a stereogenic atom.  (The exception involves Fischer projections; more on that later.)  If you use two wedges to define a stereocenter, you need to be careful how you orient them, or ACE might misinterpret your structure.  For example, suppose you wanted to draw (<I>R</I>)-2-butanol, and you drew the structure in the Marvin window.  Submit this structure. You will see that you get an error message. <p>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the H atom, and drag it above one of the horizontal bonds, so it is close to the OH (either side is OK).  Submit again.
evalFeedback	6	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-2-butanol.  The rule for using one bold and one hashed wedge to indicate a stereocenter is as follows: If the line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms joined to it by wedges bisects the line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms joined to it by regular single bonds, then the configuration can <i>not</i> be assigned.  If the two lines do <i>not</i> bisect one another, then the configuration <i>can</i> be assigned.
evalFeedback	6	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	7		On the other hand, sometimes you may use two bold or two hashed wedges to define a stereocenter's configuration.  Again, suppose you drew (<I>R</I>)-2-butanol as in the Marvin window.  Submit the structure. You will see that you get an error message. <P>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the OH group, and drag it below one of the horizontal bonds so that the H-C-O angle is close to 180&#176;.  Submit again.
evalFeedback	7	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-2-butanol.  The rule for using two bold or two hashed wedges to indicate a stereocenter is as follows: The line connecting the stereocenter and the two atoms connected to it by the wedges <i>should</i> bisect the line connecting the stereocenter and the atoms connected to it by regular single bonds.
evalFeedback	7	2	You dragged the H atom below the horizontal bonds.  You were supposed to drag the OH group.
evalFeedback	7	3	Please follow the instructions.  (Perhaps you dragged the H atom below the horizontal bonds.  You were supposed to drag the OH group.)
qStmt	8		ACE does not read the stereochemical information of Fischer projections. To correctly transfer that information to ACE, at least one wedge has to be drawn to define each stereocenter.  (Of course, this requirement defeats the purpose of Fischer projections, which is to allow absolute configuration to be represented without wedges, but there it is.)  For example, the Fischer projection in the Marvin window represents (<I>R</I>)-glyceraldehyde.  Submit it.
evalFeedback	8	1	<i>Now</i> you've drawn (<i>R</i>)-glyceraldehyde. When drawing Fischer projections in ACE, use a horizontal bold wedge to define each stereocenter.  <P>Now, from the View menu, choose Stereo &rarr; R/S Labels &rarr; All.  Press the Select button, click and hold on the bottom C, and drag it first to the left, then to the right.  Notice how the configuration changes.  When the angle between the two regular bonds, measured through the wedged bond between them, is &lt; 90&deg;, ACE assumes the fourth bond to H is next to and pointing opposite to the wedged bond.  When the angle is &ge; 90&deg;, ACE assumes the fourth bond to H is across from and pointing in the same direction as the wedged bond.  These assumptions follow from the tetrahedral nature of the C atom.
evalFeedback	8	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE does <i>not</i> interpret your response as (<i>R</i>)-glyceraldehyde.  Instead, it interprets it as if you had drawn no wedge at all!   <P>Now, turn the central C-OH bond into a Single Up bond (bold wedge), and resubmit.
evalFeedback	8	3	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	9		Double-bond stereochemistry is indicated simply by placing the appropriate groups at appropriate angles.  Inappropriate angles can lead to misinterpreted answers.  For example, suppose you wanted to draw (<I>Z</I>)-2-bromo-2-butene, in which the two CH3 groups were cis to one another, and you drew the structure in the Marvin window.  Submit it.
evalFeedback	9	1	<I>This</I> structure is interpreted as (<I>Z</I>)-2-bromo-2-butene.  The two groups attached to each C(sp2) of an alkene must lay on opposite sides of the line defined by the two C(sp2) atoms for you to be sure that the configuration will be interpreted properly.
evalFeedback	9	2	That's the E isomer.  Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	9	3	You followed the instructions, but ACE interprets your response as having indeterminate stereochemistry, neither E nor Z.  <P>Now, press the Select button, click and hold on the CH3 group closest to Br, and drag it down until it is below the line defined by the two C(sp2) atoms.  Submit.
evalFeedback	9	4	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	10		To indicate that a double bond exists as a mixture of E and Z isomers, use a wavy bond from a C(sp2) atom to one of the groups attached to it.  For example, right-click (Mac users: control- or option-click) on the bond between a CH3 group and the adjacent C atom, and choose Type &rarr; Single Up or Down (<i>not</i> Double Cis or Trans).  Submit.
evalFeedback	10	1	Good!  This structure is interpreted as neither the E nor the Z isomer, but as a mixture of both.
evalFeedback	10	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	11		Marvin allows you to see how molecules look in 3D.  However, when you draw them, you are drawing them only in 2D.  You need to instruct Marvin to minimize the structure in 3D before looking at it in 3D.  For example, draw cyclohexane.  Choose Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Add Explicit Hydrogens, and then choose Structure &rarr; Clean 3D &rarr; Clean in 3D.  To rotate the structure in space, choose View &rarr; Transform &rarr; Rotate in 3D, and click on the window, hold, and drag.  <P>Press Submit at any time.
evalFeedback	11	1	After you clean a structure in 3D, don't use wedges to indicate stereochemistry.  Wedges are ignored when Marvin is in 3D mode.  If you want to use wedges, go back to a 2D representation by choosing Structure &rarr; Clean 2D &rarr; Clean in 2D.
qStmt	12		ACE provides you with 3D chair cyclohexane and ethane templates for you to use to draw particular conformations of compound, but you need to be careful about how you add substituents to them.  For example, click on the first chair cyclohexane ring in the menu bar, and click in the Marvin window.  Now add two equatorial CH3 groups so that you have the structure in Figure 1.  Submit.
evalFeedback	12	1	Please draw 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane according to the instructions.
evalFeedback	12	2	It seems that you have clicked on a ring atom to replace a C atom with another C atom.  When you did so, you removed some hidden markings that help ACE identify which groups are axial and which are equatorial.  Please erase your structure and start over, and be careful not to replace any ring atoms.
evalFeedback	12	3	You followed the instructions, but ACE can't tell that your structure has two equatorial Me groups, because the Me groups that you drew were automatically given a z-coordinate of 0.  Choose the second button in the first toolbar, and twirl the structure until you are looking directly down at the ring, which should look like a regular hexagon. See how one of the CH3 groups is askew from where it should be?<P>Now erase your CH3 groups.  Choose Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Explicit Hydrogens.  The H atoms are placed automatically with the proper 3D coordinates.  Now press the C button, and <i>click on</i> two equatorial H atoms that are in a 1,3-relationship.  (You may want to rotate the structure again to make clear which H atoms are equatorial and which are axial.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	12	4	Now <i>that's</i> a cyclohexane with two equatorial groups!  Any atom directly attached to the ring <i>must</i> be added by replacing an H atom.  Atoms not directly attached to the ring can be added in any of the usual ways.  <P>You have now completed the MarvinSketch stereochemistry tutorial.  Feel free to come back and rework it if you need reminders.
qStmt	13		Drawing bridged bicyclic compounds with correct stereochemistry can be difficult. Figure 1 shows a perspective drawing of a bridged bicyclic compound in which the one-carbon bridge on the six-membered ring is pointing in the opposite direction from the CN group. Our eyes can understand the configurations depicted by the perspective drawing, but ACE cannot do. Figure 2 shows two sets of structures that use stereobonds to depict the configurations. In the top row are structures that correctly depict the configurations, and in the bottom row are structures that incorrectly depict the configurations. Choose View &rarr; Stereo &rarr; R/S Labels &rarr; All, and verify that all the structures in the top row have the (R,R,R) configuration, whereas that is not true of the structures in the bottom row. Now choose View &rarr; Stereo &rarr; R/S Labels &rarr; Off, delete the structures of the bottom row, and submit.
evalFeedback	13	1	Good! Students often find it easiest to use the second depiction among the correct ones.
evalFeedback	13	2	Please follow the instructions.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch mechanisms tutorial
qStmt	1		ACE provides five special toolbar buttons for drawing mechanisms: the curved arrow (to show the movement of a pair of electrons), the fishhook or half-headed arrow (to show the movement of a single electron), the rectangle or box (to enclose each step of a mechanism), the reaction arrow (to connect boxes in a logical sequence), and the resonance arrow (ditto). In the following example, you need to draw electron-flow arrows showing that the N atom uses its lone pair of electrons to make a bond to C, and that the C-Br bond breaks. First, press the toolbar button for the two-electron electron-flow arrow. Now, click on the lone pair of the N atom on the left, then slowly drag the cursor along the line between N and C until blue semicircles appear around the two atoms and a dashed line connects them, and click again. (Alternatively, click-and-hold on the lone pair of the N, drag, and release when you see the blue semicircles and the dashed line.) Now click on the C-Br bond, and move the cursor until it is on top of the Br atom. Click again to release the arrow. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Good!  An electron-flow arrow may start at an atom or bond, and it may end at an atom, a bond, or an incipient bond.  <B>Note 1</B>: Two nonbonded atoms must be further away from one another than bonding distance for you to be able to point an electron-flow arrow to between them.  <B>Note 2</B>: You can alter the arc length of an electron-flow arrow: press Select or the appropriate electron-flow arrow button, mouse over the arrow, click and hold, and drag.
qStmt	2		The reagents required for each step of a mechanism must be included in a box, and the boxes must be connected with reaction arrows. Press the button for the rectangle. Draw one rectangle around each of the three structures.  The rectangles should not be touching. Now press the button for the reaction arrow. Place the cursor over a corner or an edge midpoint of the first rectangle (you should see circles light up around the corners and edges), click and hold, drag until the cursor reaches a corner or an edge midpoint of the second rectangle and another circle appears, and release. Repeat to join the second rectangle to the third rectangle. (You don't actually need to have the arrows connecting the edges of the boxes; you can start or end arrows anywhere inside a box. But when you have arrows connect edges or corners, then, if you move the box, the arrow endpoint will move along as well.) Feel free to omit some of the reaction arrows or boxes, and see what happens.
evalFeedback	2	1	Be sure that you are using the correct kind of arrow to connect the rectangles, and be sure that the beginnings and ends of the arrows are touching the corners or edge midpoints of the appropriate rectangles.
evalFeedback	2	2	You haven't connected the boxes in the order in which I asked you to connect them.
evalFeedback	2	3	Good!  Note that the structures in each step of the mechanism may be scattered anywhere on the page; the rectangles and reaction arrows show where they fall in the reaction sequence.  You can move or resize rectangles, too.  To move, press Select, mouse over the rectangle until all eight corners and midpoints light up, click and hold, and drag.  To resize, press Select, mouse over the rectangle until just the midpoint of the side you want to move lights up, click and hold, and drag.  <P>ACE mechanisms are much easier to draw if you draw <i>first</i> structures and electron-flow arrows, <i>then</i> rectangles, and <i>then</i> reaction (or resonance) arrows to connect the rectangles.
qStmt	3		You should enclose <i>all</i> reagents involved in a particular step in a single box.  The compounds in any box include both the products of the previous step and the starting materials for the next step.  In the following mechanism, draw rectangles around the first structure, the second and third structures, and the fourth structure, and join the boxes with reaction arrows.
evalFeedback	3	1	Please follow the instructions.  Be sure that the beginnings and ends of the arrows are touching the corners or edge midpoints of the appropriate rectangles.
evalFeedback	3	2	Oops!   The first two boxes contain resonance structures, so you should use a double-headed arrow to connect them.  Erase the red reaction arrow (you need to place the cursor in such a place that three little circles appear along the arrow), press the button for the resonance (two-headed) arrow, and join the first and second boxes with a resonance arrow.
evalFeedback	3	3	You have connected the wrong boxes with a resonance arrow.
evalFeedback	3	4	Good!  ACE understands that the presence of a second starting material in the second box does not change the fact that the electron-flow arrows in the first box lead to a resonance structure in the second box.
qStmt	4		ACE understands that organic chemists may not draw one or more products of a particular mechanistic step. In the following mechanism, EtOH, one of the products from the mechanistic step in box 1, is included in box 2, and Br^-, one of the products from the mechanistic step in box 2, is included in box 3, but you may equally well omit either (if your instructor allows you to do so). Delete EtOH or Br^- or both, as you wish, and submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	4	2	Good!  ACE also understands that starting materials such as Br2 may appear later in a mechanism.
qStmt	5		Drawing electron-flow arrows pointing from a bond to an incipient (newly forming) bond can be tricky when the three atoms involved are collinear.  Press the button for the two-electron electron-flow arrow, click once (or click and hold) on the P=C double bond in the upper box, and move the cursor toward the carbonyl C atom.  As you move closer, you should see blue semicircles appear first around the P and the carbonyl C atoms, and then around the two C(sp2) atoms.  (A dashed line also appears between the atoms, but because it overlaps with the P=C double bond, it is difficult to tell which atoms it is connecting.) The location of the blue semicircles as you click the second time (or release) determines where the incipient bond will be.  If you have not moved the cursor far enough to the right, ACE will think you want to form an incipient P-C bond, not a C-C bond.  Click so that the incipient bond connects the two C(sp2) atoms, and submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	When you are drawing an electron-flow arrow, the blue semicircles indicate the atoms between which an incipient bond will be located.  After you draw the electron-flow arrow, you can still see where the incipient bond is located: press the Select button, mouse over the electron-flow arrow, and look for the thin blue rectangle that connects the two atoms of the incipient bond.  To make it easier to draw the electron-flow arrow connecting the proper atoms, click Select, click and hold on the P or either C(sp2), and drag the atom up or down so the three atoms are no longer collinear.
evalFeedback	5	2	Good!  When you are drawing an electron-flow arrow pointing to an incipient bond, blue semicircles indicate where the incipient bond will be located.  After you draw the electron-flow arrow, you can still see where the incipient bond is located: press the Select button, mouse over the electron-flow arrow, and look for the thin blue rectangle that connects the two atoms of the incipient bond.  To make it easier to draw the electron-flow arrow connecting the proper atoms, click Select, click and hold on the P or either C(sp2), and drag the atom up or down so the three atoms are no longer collinear.You can also copy your mechanistic step into the <a href="http://epoch.uky.edu/ace/public/mechmarvin.jsp" target="window3">mechanism calculator</a> and see what ACE makes of your electron-flow arrows.
qStmt	6		When you use the electrons in an X&#8211;Y #sigma or #pi bond to make a new bond between one of the bond atoms (say, X) and a third atom Z, it is important that the electron-flow arrow points from the X&#8211;Y bond to <i><b>between</b></i> atoms X and Z, not <i><b>to</b></i> atom Z. Submit the following incorrectly drawn structure. Then delete the electron-flow arrow, redraw it correctly, and submit again.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good! The reason ACE can't interpret an electron-flow arrow pointing from a bond directly to a third atom is that ACE doesn't know which atom of the bond gets to use the bond electrons to make a new bond to the third atom.
evalFeedback	6	2	Delete the electron-flow arrow, and redraw it so that it originates at the C=C &#960; bond and terminates on a line <i>between</i> the lower C of the &#960; bond and the H^+ atom. You should see blue semicircles around the lower C and the H^+ and a dashed line between them when you have positioned the cursor correctly.
qStmt	7		If two atoms are drawn within bond distance, then it becomes impossible to draw an electron-flow arrow so that it points between them. For example, try to draw an electron-flow arrow from the P=C bond to between the two C atoms and another one from the O=C bond to between the P and the O. Then move the two molecules somewhat further apart from one another, and try again.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good! If two atoms are within bonding distance, it may be hard to draw an arrow to point between them. Simply move the atoms apart, and try again.
evalFeedback	7	2	Each arrow should begin at a &#960; bond and point between either the P and the O or between the two C atoms beneath the P and the O.
qStmt	8		Sometimes, reagents above or below the arrow will be written as text, not as molecules. You won't be able to use the text in your mechanism; you will have to draw the structure yourself as a molecule. In the following example, delete the reaction arrow; draw one box around the starting materials (CH3Cl and AlCl3) and one around the product (the zwitterion);  draw the appropriate electron-flow arrow from a lone pair of the Cl of CH3Cl to an incipient Cl-Al bond; draw a reaction arrow to connect the first box to the second; and submit. Hint: You will need to redraw AlCl3.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  You can identify text by pressing the Select button (top left), then mousing over the text. If you see eight circles in the shape of a rectangle, it's text. Also, atoms are usually color-coded in molecules, whereas they are usually not in text.
evalFeedback	8	2	Either your mechanism does not include CH3Cl or AlCl3, or it does not include an electron-flow arrow showing the formation of the Cl-Al bond.
qStmt	9		Here's another example of electron-flow arrows not pointing whither they are supposed to do. In this reaction, new #sigma bonds are being made between C(1) and C(6) and between C(4) and C(5), and a #pi bond is shifting from C(1)=C(2) to C(2)=C(3). The electron-flow arrows look correct to the untrained eye, but there is an error. Submit.
evalFeedback	9	1	<p>Now choose the Select tool, click on the canvas to unselect the highlighted atom, and hover over each electron-flow arrow in turn. The blue boxes show where the electron-flow arrows originate and to where they point. You should see a blue box connecting C(1) and C(6), and another one connecting C(4) and C(5). If you see a blue box connecting a different pair of atoms in the two reactants, then the corresponding electron-flow arrow is drawn incorrectly. Delete that arrow, redraw it so that it connects the correct pair of atoms (look for the dashed line to connect the appropriate atoms as you move the mouse), and submit again.
evalFeedback	9	2	Good! Do you see the very small apparent difference between the corrected figure and the original figure? When you draw electron-flow arrows, you need to be careful to point them to the right places, or ACE will object.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch radical mechanisms tutorial
qStmt	1		In a free-radical mechanism, we use one-electron electron-flow arrows to draw the movement of electrons, and we sometimes have to draw a lot of them. In the following example, you will draw the arrows for a radical atom abstraction step. Press the button for the one-electron electron-flow (half-headed or fishhook) arrow. Click on the unpaired electron of either O atom in box 1, drag the cursor along the line between that O and H until they are enclosed in blue semicircles and a dashed line connects them, and click again. (Again, you may instead click-hold, drag, and release.)  Now click on the C-H bond and then on the tip of the first arrow you drew; before you click the second time, make sure that the blue semicircles surround and a dashed line connects the same O and H atoms that they did in the first step. Now click on the C-H bond and then on the C. Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	1	2	Good! The reaction between a free radical and a nonradical almost always involves three one-electron electron-flow arrows.
qStmt	2		Now draw the electron-flow arrows for a radical addition to a &#960; bond. Press the button for the one-electron electron-flow (half-headed or fishhook) arrow. In box 1, place a one-electron arrow pointing from the unpaired electron of the C&bull; to between C&bull; and CH2, from the C=C bond to between C&bull; and CH2, and from the C=C bond to the C attached to Ph. Submit.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Good! If you want to practice drawing electron-flow arrows and seeing what ACE calculates as the products of your electron-flow arrows, visit ACE's <a href="http://epoch.uky.edu/ace/public/mechmarvin.jsp" target="window3">mechanism calculator</a>.
qStmt	3		Most of the mechanisms involving free radicals that you will draw are chain mechanisms. A chain mechanism has three parts: initiation, propagation, and termination. ACE will not ask you to draw the termination part of a mechanism. The initiation part of a mechanism is usually one or two steps; the propagation part can be any number of steps, and is often only two steps. A free radical chain mechanism has stoichiometric starting materials and products, and it often has a catalyst, though not always.<p>The initiation part of the mechanism involves the conversion of one of the stoichiometric starting materials into a free radical. In the reaction shown in Figure 1, no chemical initiator is added to the reaction to convert one of the stoichiometric starting materials into a free radical, but light causes the weakest bond in the reaction mixture, the C&#8211;Br bond, to undergo #sigma-bond homolysis. Draw the electron-flow arrows that show the homolytic cleavage of the C-Br bond (two one-electron arrows begin at the C-Br bond; one points to C, the other to Br), and draw the products of this reaction in the second box.
evalFeedback	3	1	Don't change the structure of the starting material.
evalFeedback	3	2	What are the products of #sigma-bond homolysis of the C-Br bond?
evalFeedback	3	4	Good! Two radicals are produced. The alkyl radical will be the starting point for the propagation part of the mechanism.
qStmt	4		The propagation part of a free radical chain mechanism has the following characteristics. <ol><li>Every propagation step involves an odd-electron compound being converted to a new odd-electron compound.</li><li>The initiation part of the mechanism produces the odd-electron compound used in the first propagation step.</li><li>The last propagation step produces the odd-electron compound that is used in the first propagation step.</li><li>Every stoichiometric starting material appears in the propagation, <i>even though</i> it may also appear in the initiation.</li><li>Every product of the mechanism is produced in the propagation.</li><li>If an initiator is present, its parts do not appear int he propagation.</li></ol>

<p>The reaction shown in Figure 1 is an addition reaction, with the mechanism appearing in Figure 2. You've already drawn the initiation part of the mechanism, which is now the first step of the mechanism shown here. The remaining steps of the mechanism constitute the propagation part of the mechanism. Note a few things about the way it has been drawn.<ol><li>In this particular example, the propagation part has just two steps, represented by the two boxes in which radicals appear (and react).</li><li>The second (last) step of the propagation produces the radical produced in the initation, and this radical already appears in the first step of the propagation, so there is a reaction arrow pointing from the second (last) step of the propagation back to the first step of the propagation! This arrow completes the circle of the propagation.</li><li>Also produced in the last step of the propagation is the one product of this reaction. This product is drawn in its own box, and the arrow that points to this box branches off the midpoint of the arrow that points from the second (last) step of the propagation back to the first step of the propagation.</li></ol>

<p>Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Don't change the structure of the starting materials.
evalFeedback	4	2	Don't change the product of the reaction.
evalFeedback	4	4	Good!
qStmt	5		Figure 2 shows the initiation and propagation parts of the mechanism of the reaction in Figure 1. Arrange the mechanism in boxes and with reaction arrows so that ACE will be able to interpret it properly.
evalFeedback	5	1	Your mechanism must include both of the starting materials of the reaction.
evalFeedback	5	2	The organic product of the reaction must appear in your mechanism.
evalFeedback	5	3	Don't use a resonance arrow to connect two boxes that do not contain resonance structures.  If you want two boxes to point to one another, you have to use two reaction arrows.  Remember that a reaction arrow can link any edge midpoint or corner of one rectangle to any edge midpoint or corner of the other.
evalFeedback	5	4	You have drawn a linear mechanism, not a chain one.  Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step, and this box has two reaction arrows pointing to it.
evalFeedback	5	5	Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step, and this box has two reaction arrows pointing to it.
evalFeedback	5	6	Although you have drawn a mechanism with a cyclic topology, you have not drawn boxes and arrows that are correct for this mechanism.  Remember: The box containing the starting materials for the first propagation step also contains the products of the last propagation step.  Your mechanism should have three boxes and three reaction arrows.  Two boxes should be pointing to one, which should point back at one of the two.
evalFeedback	5	7	Your mechanism does not show the initiation step, in which Br2 is converted to 2Br&middot;.
evalFeedback	5	8	Good!  A reaction with two propagation steps contains two boxes in the cyclic part, which point to one another.  Again, ACE will not expect you to draw termination steps as part of a free-radical chain mechanism.  <P>You have now completed the mechanism tutorial.  Good luck!
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch SRN1 tutorial
qStmt	1		Drawing reactions involving electron transfer can be challenging.  There are two electron transfer cases: those in which the electron is transferred into a #sigma* orbital, and those in which it is transferred into a #pi* orbital.  In the following example of the first case, P transfers an electron into the #sigma* orbital associated with the C-Br bond.  Draw a one-electron arrow from P <i>directly</i> to Br, the more electronegative of the two atoms of the C-Br bond.  When you draw the products, decrease the formal charge of Br by 1, and make it a radical; and increase the formal charge of P by 1, and make it a radical. [MarvinSketch may add two implicit H atoms to your P radical cation, and it may underline the Br atom to indicate a valence error; if it does either of these things, ignore them, they are bugs.]
evalFeedback	1	1	The electron donor, P, should have its charge increased by 1 and should become a radical.
evalFeedback	1	2	The electron recipient, Br, should have its charge decreased by 1 and should become a radical.
evalFeedback	1	3	A one-electron arrow should point directly from P to Br.
evalFeedback	1	4	Good!
qStmt	2		In the following example of electron transfer to a #pi* orbital, Na transfers an electron into the #pi* orbital associated with the C=O bond.  Draw a one-electron arrow from Na <i>directly</i> to C, the <i>less</i> electronegative of the two atoms of the #pi bond, and draw a two-electron arrow from the #pi bond to O, the <i>more</i> electronegative of the two atoms of the #pi bond.  When you draw the products, increase the formal charge of Na by 1 and make it a nonradical; make the C atom into a radical; decrease the formal charge of O by 1; and decrease the order of the C-O bond by 1.
evalFeedback	2	1	The electron donor, Na&middot;, should have its charge increased by 1 and should have its radical status turned off.
evalFeedback	2	2	The electron recipient, C, should become a radical, the O atom should have its formal charge decreased by 1, and the order of the C-O bond should decrease by 1.
evalFeedback	2	3	A one-electron arrow should point directly from Na to the carbonyl C, and a two-electron arrow should point from the C=O #pi bond to O.
evalFeedback	2	4	Good!
qStmt	3		After an electron is transferred into a #sigma* orbital, the next step is often cleavage of the bond associated with that orbital.  Draw a one-electron arrow from the C-Br bond to the Br atom (if the Br has a valence error, ignore it) and another one-electron arrow from the C-Br bond to the C atom.  Then draw the two products of the reaction, (CH3)3C&middot; and Br^-. [MarvinSketch may highlight the starting Br with a valence error; if it does, ignore it, it's a bug.]
evalFeedback	3	1	The Br atom leaves with a pair of electrons and a negative charge to become Br^-.
evalFeedback	3	2	The C-Br bond breaks homolytically, so the C atom gets one unshared electron.
evalFeedback	3	3	One-electron arrows should point from the C-Br bond to each of the two atoms in the bond.
evalFeedback	3	4	Good!
qStmt	4		An electron-sufficient nucleophile will often make a bond to a radical in an SRN1 mechanism. In the following example, copy the starting materials into the product window. In the starting materials window, draw a one-electron arrow from P to <i>between</i> P and the C radical, and draw another one-electron arrow from the C radical to <i>between</i> the C radical and P. Then, in the product window, join the C radical and P with a single bond, change the C radical property to none, and change the P radical property to monovalent. Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	In the product, the P atom becomes a monovalent radical, but its formal charge remains unchanged.
evalFeedback	4	2	One-electron arrows should point from P to between P and C&middot; and from C&middot; to between P and C&middot;.
evalFeedback	4	3	Good!  You now have completed the steps necessary to draw an S<sub>RN</sub>1 mechanism.  Feel free to review these last few exercises when you encounter S<sub>RN</sub>1 mechanisms in the future.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch multistep synthesis tutorial
qStmt	1		A multistep synthesis question consists of a target of the synthesis and a series of starting materials and intermediates enclosed in boxes connected by linear arrows.  In addition, a box (except the one containing the target) may contain a number, and a user should choose reaction conditions to associate with each number.  In the following example, press the <b>T</b> button on the Marvin toolbar, click anywhere inside the box containing benzene (the first box), and type <b>1</b>.  Then click on <b>Add first reaction condition</b> (underneath the Marvin window), and click on <b>[simply mix]</b> to change this set of reaction conditions.  In the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>NaNO2, aq. HCl</b>.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	1	You followed the instructions, but NaNO2 and aq. HCl do not react with benzene, and ACE knows that.  Click on <b>NaNO2, aq. HCl</b>, and then, in the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>Br2, FeBr3</b>.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	2	You followed the instructions, but, although Br2 and FeBr3 react with benzene, they don't add an NO2 group, and ACE knows that.  Now click on <b>Br2, FeBr3</b>, and then, in the popup window, click on <b>Acidic</b> and then on <b>HNO3</b>.  Submit.
evalFeedback	1	3	Good!
evalFeedback	1	4	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	2		One of the reaction conditions that is always available to you is <b>[simply mix]</b>.  You will want to use this reaction condition when you treat one compound with a reagent to make it reactive, and then add another compound.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	2	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	2	2	Good!  You could also omit adding reaction condition 2 or the number <b>2</b> in the second box or both.  If ACE cannot find a reaction condition that corresponds to a box, or if a box does not contain a number, ACE assumes that the reaction condition for that box is <b>[simply mix]</b>.
qStmt	3		You can draw a convergent synthesis, in which you combine two compounds that must both be prepared.  Suppose you are asked to prepare the target compound in the rightmost box from benzene and propionic acid (CH3CH2CO2H).  Although the drawn synthesis now works as written, it does not use the correct starting materials.  See what happens when you submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	One of the starting materials of this synthesis does not have the characteristics of a permissible starting material.  You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that chlorobenzene is not a permissible starting material.  Follow these instructions: <ol><li>Draw benzene to the left of the left-hand box.  <li>Box benzene. <li>Place a 2 in the box with benzene.   <li>Draw an arrow from the new box to the middle box.  <li>Click <b>Insert after here</b> on line 1 to add a line for reaction condition 2.  <li>Choose <b>Electrophilic halogen</b> &rarr; <b>Cl2, FeCl3</b> for reaction condition 2.  <li>Submit.</ol>
evalFeedback	3	2	One of the starting materials of this synthesis does not have the characteristics of a permissible starting material.  You again followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that CH3CH2COCl is not a permissible starting material, either.  Follow these instructions: <ol><li>Press <b>Select</b>, copy CH3CH2COCl, and paste it under (not in) the benzene-containing box.  <li>Change the Cl of the newly pasted compound to OH.  <li>Box CH3CH2CO2H.  <li>Draw an arrow from the new box to the middle one.  You should now have four boxes, with two of the boxes pointing to the one in the middle.  <li>Place a 3 in the new box.  <li>Add a line for reaction condition 3.  <li>Choose <b>Electrophilic main group (not halogen)</b> &rarr; <b>SOCl2</b> for reaction condition 3.  <li>Submit.</ol>
evalFeedback	3	3	Good!  A convergent synthesis can have any number of branches of any length, though it is very rare that you will ever see more than two arrows pointing to a single box.  <i>Always</i> read carefully what starting materials you may use for your synthesis.  Also, note that the numbers in the boxes need not be in any particular order.
evalFeedback	3	4	Please draw compounds and choose reaction conditions according to the instructions.
qStmt	4		ACE will alert you if your synthesis produces the wrong compound or stereoisomer.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	4	1	You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that H2, Lindlar cat. will make the cis alkene, not the trans alkene.  Click on <b>H2, Lindlar cat.</b> and choose <b>Reduction</b> &rarr; <b>Li (2 equiv), liq. NH3, <i>t</i>-BuOH</b> instead.  Submit.
evalFeedback	4	2	The new set of reaction conditions produces the trans alkene.  Note that it was not necessary to assign the reaction condition <b>[simply mix]</b> to box 2, but you could do so if you wanted.
qStmt	5		ACE may alert you if your synthesis produces not only the compound you indicate, but also other diastereomers or compounds.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	5	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	5	2	You followed the instructions, but the reaction condition that you were directed to choose produced not only the diastereomer shown, but another as well.  (The calculated products also include both enantiomeric forms.)  Click on <b>H2O, conc. H2SO4</b>, choose <b>Addition</b> &rarr; <b>BH3 or (R)2BH; then H2O2, aq. NaOH</b>, and submit.
evalFeedback	5	3	The new reaction condition is diastereoselective.  ACE is also capable of determining whether your synthesis produces only a single enantiomer of the target compound.
qStmt	6		ACE may alert you if you go the trouble of preparing a compound that is a permissible starting material.  In the following example, you were asked to produce the target alkene from <b>any alkyne</b> and any other compound containing <b>no more than three contiguous C atoms</b>.  Submit the following reaction sequence.
evalFeedback	6	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	6	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE recognizes that the compounds in boxes 2 and 3 are alkynes, which makes them permissible starting materials, so you should not have gone to the trouble of preparing them.  Delete boxes 1 and 2 and their contents, and submit again.  (You don't need to delete reaction condition 1; if ACE doesn't find a box with the number of a reaction condition, it will ignore that reaction condition.  However, if it really bugs you to have a useless reaction condition 1, you can press the <b>Remove</b> link next to it.  Note, however, that reaction condition 2 is then renumbered as reaction condition 1, and you will need to change the number in the corresponding box from 2 to 1.  Press the Text button on the Marvin toolbar, click on 2, highlight it, and type 1.)
evalFeedback	6	3	Good.  Because the permissible starting materials were defined as "any alkyne and any other compound containing no more than three contiguous C atoms," the synthesis you have now is correct.  If they had been defined as "any compound containing no more than three contiguous C atoms," then the original synthesis would have been correct.
qStmt	7		ACE understands that organic chemists don't pay much attention to stoichiometry.  ACE will automatically incorporate two equivalents of a reagent if that is its normal pattern of reactivity; you don't need to (shouldn't) draw the reagent twice.  In the following example, draw CH3Li alongside the ester in box 1, and submit.  (You don't need to indicate a particular reaction condition, because if you indicate none, ACE will apply "[simply mix]".)
evalFeedback	7	2	Good.  You can see that two CH3 groups are incorporated into the product, even though you only drew one equivalent of CH3Li in the first box.  You can also see that ACE assumes that the product you draw in the subsequent box is the product that is obtained after ordinary aqueous workup.<p>You have reached the end of the tutorial.</p>
qStmt	8		One aspect of synthesis questions that can be confusing is when you need to draw intermediates.  For example, in the following reaction, you want to remove an H atom from the #a-carbon of the ketone and then do a substitution reaction to add the CH3 group to it.  To do this reaction, you need to add a base.  I've chosen LDA for you as your base.  Go ahead and submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	You followed the instructions, but ACE marked this answer as wrong, because applying LDA to a ketone to generate the corresponding enolate needs to be done in a step <i>separate</i> from the addition of the CH3I.  It <i>is</i> possible to generate the enolate in the <i>presence</i> of the CH3I, but in that case, you would use a different base.  Click on <b>LDA (LiN(i-Pr)2)</b>, choose <b>Basic &rarr; NaO-<i>t</i>-Bu (&ge; 1 equiv.), #heat</b>, and submit again.
evalFeedback	8	2	You followed the instructions, but ACE marked this answer as wrong, because when you apply a moderate base to a ketone, polyalkylation occurs.  To draw the monoalkylation, first place a negative charge on the C of cyclohexanone that is adjacent to the carbonyl C.  Then draw cyclohexanone to the left of the first box, box it, and draw an arrow from that box to the one containing the anion.  Move the <b>1</b> from the second box to the first one, change the reaction condition back to <b>LDA (LiN(i-Pr)2)</b>, and submit again.
evalFeedback	8	3	Good!  In general, it's better to generate the anion in one step and then add the electrophile in the next step, although there are exceptions (carbonyl poly-#a-alkylation, Michael reaction) to this rule.
qStmt	9		ACE will sometimes object if you draw a reagent in MarvinSketch when that reagent is available from the reagent window.  For example, see what happens when you submit the following reaction.  <p>Afterwards, add the reaction condition <b>AlCl3</b> from the reagent menu (you can find it in the  <b>Acidic</b> section), delete the AlCl3 structure from box 1, add the number <b>1</b> to box 1, and resubmit.
evalFeedback	9	1	Please follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	9	2	Good!  Now ACE is happy with your response.  Most of the compounds that ACE will not accept from MarvinSketch are small inorganic reagents such as H2, PCl3, and Br2, although 1,2-ethanediol (HOCH2CH2OH) is in the list as well.
Topic: Tutorials; Set: MarvinSketch organometallic mechanisms tutorial
qStmt	1		A coordinate bond is a bond formed between a Lewis base and a Lewis acid such as a metal, represented by L&rarr;M or ^+L&ndash;M^-.  (Organometallic chemists often draw L&ndash;M, omitting the formal charges, but ACE will not accept such a depiction.)  In MarvinSketch, the toolbar contains a button for the coordinate bond; it is next to the other bond buttons, and its icon is a straight <b>black</b> arrow.  In Marvin JS, the coordinate bond button can be found in the lower right corner of the submenu for the Bond button. In the following structure, connect both P atoms to Pd with coordinate bonds.  Make sure that the arrow of the bond points toward the metal.  If, when you draw the coordinate bond, it is pointing in the wrong direction, simply click on it to change its direction.
evalFeedback	1	1	Good! Each coordinate bond must originate at the atom that contributes two electrons to the bond.
evalFeedback	1	2	Make sure both coordinate bonds are pointing from P to Pd.  Click on the coordinate bond button and then on the coordinate bond to reverse its direction.
evalFeedback	1	3	No, try again.  Use the correct bond to connect P and Pd.
qStmt	2		If you really don't like coordinate bonds L&rarr;M, you can use the alternate ^+L&ndash;M^- resonance structure.  Alter the following structure so that each P has a formal charge of +1, Pd has a formal charge of 2&minus;, and the P-Pd bonds are regular single bonds.
evalFeedback	2	1	Good!  ACE doesn't care which formalism you use, but your instructor might do, so ask him or her.
evalFeedback	2	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	3		You can draw a coordinate bond from a C-C multiple bond to a metal.  In the following structure, select the two C atoms of the &#960; bond in CH2=CHCH3, and then choose Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Multi-Center.  You will see a small asterisk near the center of the C=C double bond.  Press the coordinate bond button, and then draw a bond from the asterisk to Pt.  The new bond will appear as a hashed line.  Submit.
evalFeedback	3	1	Good!  You can do the same with alkynes.  Note that the two electrons in the bond between Pt and the alkene are <i>the same</i> two electrons in the #pi bond between the two C atoms.  This point will become important later in the discussion of how to draw mechanisms involving organometallic compounds.
evalFeedback	3	2	Please follow the instructions.
qStmt	4		Compounds that contain a #pi-allyl group, such as the Pd complex in Figure 1, are very common.  To draw the structure shown in Figure 1, select the three C atoms in the structure presented to you, and then choose Bond &rarr; Type &rarr; Aromatic followed by Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Multi-Center.  You will see a small asterisk to the left of the middle C atom.  Press the coordinate bond button, and then draw a bond from the asterisk to Pd.  The bond will appear as a hashed line.  Submit.
evalFeedback	4	1	Good!  When you have a ligand with an odd number of C atoms, the atoms in the ligand should have aromatic bonds to one another.  Note, by the way, that there is no way to avoid using the coordinate bond when drawing multiatom ligands.
evalFeedback	4	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	5		Another common group is the cyclopentadienyl, or Cp, ligand.  In this exercise, you will draw CpFe(CO)2Cl.  Start by selecting all of the atoms of the five-membered ring and choosing Bond &rarr; Type &rarr; Aromatic, followed by Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Multi-Center.  An asterisk will appear inside of the circle that represents the five aromatic bonds.  Then press the coordinate bond button, and draw bonds from the asterisk to Fe and from each of the C^- atoms to Fe.  Submit.
evalFeedback	5	1	Good!  Although practicing chemists often omit the formal charges in CO ligands, ACE requires that you include them.
evalFeedback	5	2	Please start again, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	6		Another way of drawing an &eta;3-allyl complex, the structure in Figure 1, is as an &eta;1,&eta;2-allyl complex, in which a terminal C atom of the allyl group has an ordinary #sigma bond to Pd, and the other two C atoms use the electrons of an ordinary #pi bond to coordinate to Pd.  Starting with the structure in Figure 2, connect one of the terminal C atoms to Pd, and add a #pi bond between the <i>other</i> two C atoms.  Then add a coordinate bond pointing from the C=C #pi bond to Pd, taking care to select only the two C atoms of the #pi bond before you choose Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Multi-Center.  Submit.
evalFeedback	6	1	Good!  The structure you have drawn is a resonance structure of ClPd(&eta;3-allyl), the structure in Figure 1.  Although these structures are <i>resonance structures</i>, ACE will treat them as <i>identical</i> in <i>mechanism</i> questions, as you will see soon.
evalFeedback	6	2	The structure you have drawn is identical to ClPd(&eta;3-allyl), the structure in Figure 1.  Please start over, and follow the instructions.
evalFeedback	6	3	The structure you have drawn is not a resonance structure of ClPd(&eta;3-allyl), the structure in Figure 1.  Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	7		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 1a: Coordination of a ligand through a single atom.  In box 1, draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the P atom on the left to an incipient P-Pd bond.  Next, in box 2, add the appropriate coordinate bond to the product.  (Make sure you use the <i>coordinate bond</i> button,whose icon is a straight <b>black</b> arrow and which is located next to the other bond buttons.)  Finally, add a reaction arrow pointing from box 1 to box 2.  (Make sure you use the <i>reaction arrow</i> button, whose icon is a straight <b><span style="color:#3A9DA0;">green-blue</span></b> arrow.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	7	1	Good!  You can equally well draw the new coordinate bond in the ^+P-Pd^- resonance form, with a regular single bond.  Don't confuse the coordinate bond and graphical arrows!
evalFeedback	7	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	8		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 1b: Coordination of a ligand through a multiple bond.  Select the two C atoms of the C=C bond in box 1.  (Do not select the CO2Et group as well.)  Choose Structure &rarr; Add &rarr; Multi-Center.  An asterisk will appear near the middle of the multiple bond.  Now draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the <i>asterisk</i> to an incipient asterisk&#8211;Pd bond.  Take care that your arrow starts at the asterisk and not at the multiple bond itself, and take care that the incipient bond is between the asterisk and Pd, not between Pd and either C atom of the multiple bond.  (Look for the blue circle around the asterisk as you mouse over it; avoid the semicircles around the C atoms of the multiple bond.)  Submit.
evalFeedback	8	1	Good!  The head of the arrow can equally well point to between the asterisk and Pd, or directly to the Pd atom.
evalFeedback	8	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	9		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 1c: Coordination of a ligand through a multiple bond.  When a multiple bond coordinates to a metal that has at least two valence electrons, the resulting complex can be drawn in two different ways.  One way is to show a coordinate bond from the multiple bond to the metal, as in the previous question.  The other way is to show two #sigma bonds between the metal and the two atoms of the multiple bond, and to reduce the order of the multiple bond by 1, as in Figure 1.  <p><i>ACE treats these two depictions as exactly equivalent in mechanism questions.</i>  In other words, you can draw either structure as the product of the <i>same</i> set of electron-flow arrows.  In the following example, select the two atoms of the alkyne, make them into a multiatom group, and draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the asterisk of the multiatom group to Pd.  Submit.
evalFeedback	9	1	Good!  The electron-flow arrow you drew leads to an alkyne&#8211;Ti #pi complex, with a coordinate bond between the C#tripleC bond and Ti, but ACE recognizes the titanacyclopropene structure in box 2 as exactly equivalent to an alkyne&#8211;Ti #pi complex.  You can equally well draw two electron-flow arrows, one from the multiple bond to an incipient Ti&#8211;C bond, and the other from Ti to the other C of the multiple bond.  And you can equally well draw the product as an alkyne&#8211;metal #pi complex.  Use the Practice button to try some other combinations of electron-flow arrows and depictions.  Which form of the product is better to draw depends on what you want to do next.
evalFeedback	9	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	10		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 1d: Coordination of a ligand through three or more atoms.  In the following reaction, when the carbanion reacts with Fe, the product has a new bond between Fe and (collectively) all five atoms of the Cp group.  In the first box of the mechanism, draw electron-flow arrows that show C^- making a bond to Fe and the Fe-Cl bond breaking to give Cl^-, and submit.
evalFeedback	10	1	You followed the instructions, but your mechanism is not correct, because you did not show all five of the C atoms of the nucleophile coordinating to the metal to make an &eta;5-cyclopentadienyl group.  In the box on the left, highlight the four C atoms of the double bonds in the Cp^- nucleophile (do <i>not</i> highlight the C^- atom), and make it a multicenter group.  Then draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the asterisk of the multicenter group to the Fe atom.  Submit again.
evalFeedback	10	2	Good!  Note that the odd-atom ligand (Cp) in the product has aromatic bonds between all its atoms, just like the allyl group did.
evalFeedback	10	3	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	11		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 2: Dissociation of a multiple-bond ligand from a metal.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the center of the coordinate alkene&#8211;Pd bond to the terminus of the coordinate bond at the middle of the C=C double bond, and submit.
evalFeedback	11	1	Good!  The two electrons in the coordinate bond are the same two electrons as in the multiple bond, so this particular electron-flow arrow merely shows those two electrons returning to whence they came.
evalFeedback	11	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	12		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 3a: Oxidative addition.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Pd to an incipient Pd-Br bond, and draw another one from the C-Br bond to an incipient Pd-C bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	12	1	Good!  You can equally well draw the two arrows in a different way: one from Pd to an incipient Pd-C bond, and the other from the C-Br bond to an incipient Pd-Br bond.  Either way is correct.
evalFeedback	12	2	Please start again, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	13		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 3b: Oxidative addition to an allyl group.  Draw oxidative addition of Pd to the C-OAc bond like you did in the previous question.
evalFeedback	13	1	You followed the instructions, but the product of the electron-flow arrows that you drew is an &eta;1-allyl complex, in which only one of the C atoms of the allyl group is bonded to C.  To show that the other two C atoms of the allyl group are bonded to C as well, highlight them, make them into a multicenter group, and draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the asterisk at the center of the group to Pd.  Submit.
evalFeedback	13	2	Good!  You can draw the resulting allyl compound either in its &eta;3 form, as in Figure 1, or in its &eta;1,&eta;2 form.  ACE treats the two structures as <i>identical</i> (not as resonance structures) in mechanism questions.
evalFeedback	13	3	Please start again, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	14		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 4a: Reductive elimination.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C-Rh bond to an incipient C-H bond, and draw another from the Rh-H bond to Rh.
evalFeedback	14	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	14	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	15		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 4b: Reductive elimination of HX with the aid of a base.  When reductive elimination of HX occurs in the presence of a base, the mechanism is often drawn in a way analogous to carbene formation: deprotonation of the metal with the base, and concomitant departure of X^-.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from N to an incipient N-H bond, from the H-Pd bond to Pd, and from the Pd-Br bond to Br.  Submit.
evalFeedback	15	1	Good! It's strange to think of a deprotonation as causing the reduction of a metal, but that's what happens.
evalFeedback	15	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	16		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 4c: Reductive elimination of an allyl group.  In the following example, ligand substitution occurs in step 1, and a reductive elimination involving an allyl group occurs in step 2.  Note that box 1 shows the Pd-allyl complex in its &eta;3 depiction, and box 2, in preparation for the reductive elimination, shows the allyl complex in its &eta;1,&eta;2 depiction; correctly, no electron-flow arrows have been used to show how the &eta;3 depiction is converted into the &eta;1,&eta;2 depiction, because ACE treats the two as identical.  In box 2, I have labeled the two C atoms attached to Pd, C^1 and C^2.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Pd-C^1 bond to an incipient C^1&#8211;C^2 bond, and draw another from the Pd-C^2 bond to Pd.  Submit.
evalFeedback	16	1	You followed the instructions, but the mechanism is incorrect, because you failed to show the dissociation of the alkene from Pd.  In box 2, draw a third two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Pd-alkene coordinate bond to the terminus of the coordinate bond close to the alkene, and submit.
evalFeedback	16	2	Good!  Don't forget to show the decoordination of the alkene from the metal when drawing a reductive elimination of an allyl group.
evalFeedback	16	3	Please start again, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	17		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 5a: Insertion of an uncoordinated #pi bond into a metal&#8211;ligand #sigma bond.  I have labeled the two C atoms of the alkene as C^1 and C^2.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Rh-H bond to an incipient C^2&#8211;H bond, and draw another two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C^1=C^2 #pi bond to an incipient C^1&#8211;Rh bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	17	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	17	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	18		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 5b: Migratory insertion of a coordinated #pi bond into a metal&#8211;ligand #sigma bond.  In box 2, I've labeled the C atoms of the &#960; bond coordinated to Rh as C^1 and C^2. Draw an electron-flow arrow from the Rh-H bond to an incipient H&#8211;C^2 bond, and draw another from the dative alkene&#8211;Rh bond to an incipient bond between Rh and C^1.
evalFeedback	18	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows in the second step.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	18	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	19		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 5c: Migratory insertion of CO into a metal&#8211;ligand #sigma bond.  The mechanism of insertion of CO usually begins by coordination of the CO to the metal, as shown in step 1.  In box 2, I have labeled the C atom of CO attached to Rh as C^1, and the C(sp3) atom attached to Rh as C^2.  Draw an electron-flow arrow from the Rh&#8211;C^2 bond to an incipient C^1&#8211;C^2 bond, and draw a second electron-flow arrow from the C#tripleO bond to O.  Submit.
evalFeedback	19	1	Good!  Note that the C^1&#8211;Rh bond that is coordinate in box 2 is a regular single bond in box 3.  If we do not make this change, then, in box 3, the C atom would have to retain its formal charge of -1, and the Rh atom would have to gain a formal charge of +1.  By changing the C^1&#8211;Rh bond to a regular single bond, the formal charge on C^1 increases (to 0), and the formal charge on Rh decreases (to 0).  Alternatively, we could have drawn the ^-C^1&rarr;Rh coordinate bond in box 2 as a neutral C^1&#8211;Rh^- single bond.
evalFeedback	19	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	20		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 6a: #b-Elimination with dissociation of the resulting #pi bond.  In the first box, I've labeled the C atom attached to Ph as C^1, and the C atom attached to CO2Et, C^2.  Draw an electron-flow arrow from the C^2&#8211;H bond to an incipient Pd-H bond, and draw another electron-flow arrow from the Pd-C^1 bond to the C^1&#8211;C^2 bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	20	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	20	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	21		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 6b: #b-Elimination without dissociation of the resulting #pi bond.  If you want to show the product alkene of the #b-hydride elimination remaining coordinated to the metal, you need to draw a third electron-flow arrow to show the new #pi bond coordinating to the metal.  In the first box, I've labeled the C atom attached to Ph as C^1, and the C atom attached to CO2Et, C^2.  First, draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C^2&#8211;H bond to an incipient Pd-H bond, another from the Pd-C^1 bond to the C^1&#8211;C^2 bond.  Now, select C^1 and C^2 and make them a multicenter group.   Finally, draw a third two-electron electron-flow arrow from the asterisk of the multiatom group to an incipient group&#8211;Pd bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	21	1	Good!  The second and third arrows represent the <i>same</i> pair of electrons.
evalFeedback	21	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	22		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 7: #a-Insertion.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C-Os bond to an incipient bond between the same C and the bottommost O atom, and draw a second two-electron electron-flow arrow from the bottommost O=Os double bond to Os.  Submit.
evalFeedback	22	1	Good!  #a-Insertion is not an often-invoked mechanistic step, but it pops up occasionally.
evalFeedback	22	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	23		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 8: #a-Elimination.  I've labeled the C(sp3) attached to Ta in box 1 as C^1.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from Ta to the Ta&#8211;C^1 bond, and draw another two-electron electron-flow arrow from an H-C^1 bond to an incipient H&#8211;Ta bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	23	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	23	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	24		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 9a: #sigma-Bond metathesis.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Ti&#8211;O bond to an incipient O&#8211;Si bond, and draw a second two-electron electron-flow arrow from the H-Si bond to an incipient Ti&#8211;H bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	24	1	Good!  Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	24	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	25		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 9b: Transmetallation.   Transmetallation is a type of #sigma-bond metathesis in which two of the four atoms involved in bond changes are metals.  In box 1, I've labeled the C of the vinyl group that is attached to Sn as C^1.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C^1&#8211;Sn bond to an incipient C^1&#8211;Pd bond, and draw a second two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Pd-Br bond to an incipient Br-Sn bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	25	1	Good!  By the way, if the metal of the nucleophile (Sn in this case) is an especially electropositive metal such as Li or Mg, you can instead draw the transmetallation reaction as an SN2 substitution at the transition metal.  For less electronegative metals such as Sn, however, the four-centered transmetallation reaction is usually preferable.
evalFeedback	25	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	26		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 9c: #b-Abstraction.  I've labeled the C atom of the CH3 group as C^1, and the #b-C of the phenyl group as C^2.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Zr&#8211;C^1 bond to an incipient C^1&#8211;H bond, and draw a second two-electron electron-flow arrow from the C^2-H bond to an incipient C^2&#8211;Zr bond.  Submit.
evalFeedback	26	1	Good!  #b-Hydride abstraction reactions are also especially common with metals that have no valence electrons (usually early metals).  Note that you can equally well choose to draw the product in its metal&#8211;alkyne #pi complex depiction.
evalFeedback	26	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	27		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 9d: #a-Abstraction.  I've labeled the C atom that is immediately to the right of Ta as C^1, and the C atom that is immediately below Ta as C^2.  Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from one of the C^1&#8211;H bonds to the Ta&#8211;C^1 bond, and draw a second two-electron electron-flow arrow from the Ta&#8211;C^2 bond to an incipient bond to the H atom whose bond to C^1 is breaking.
evalFeedback	27	1	Good!  #a-Hydride abstraction reactions are not very common, but they pop up occasionally.
evalFeedback	27	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	28		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 10a: [2 + 2] Cycloaddition without coordination of the alkene.  I think you can figure out the electron-flow arrows on this one without my help.
evalFeedback	28	1	Good! Again, there is another, equally valid way to draw the two electron-flow arrows.  See if you can figure it out.
evalFeedback	28	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	29		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 10b: [2 + 2] Cycloaddition with prior coordination of the alkene.  In box 2, I've labeled the terminal C atom of the alkene as C^1, the C atom double-bonded to it as C^2, and the C atom double-bonded to Ru as C^3. Draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from the alkene&#8211;Ru coordinate bond to a C^1&#8211;Ru incipient bond, and another from the Ru&#8211;C^3 bond to an incipient C^2&#8211;C^3 bond. Submit.
evalFeedback	29	1	Good!  Note that the electrons in the coordinate bond are the same as the electrons in the C^1=C^2 &#960; bond. You could also redraw the Ru&#8211;(C^1=C^2) complex in its metallacyclopropane form, and then treat the reaction like an #a-insertion.
evalFeedback	29	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	30		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 11a: Attack of a nucleophile on a coordinated multiple bond.  In box 2, draw a two-electron electron-flow arrow from O to one of the C atoms, and draw another two-electron electron-flow arrow from the alkene&#8211;Pd coordinate bond to an incipient bond between Pd and the other C atom of the alkene.  Submit. NOT YET WORKING.
evalFeedback	30	1	Good!  The two electrons of the C=C #pi bond are also represented by the coordinate bond between the alkene and the metal; those two electrons are used to make the new Pd-C #sigma bond.
evalFeedback	30	2	Please start over, and follow the instructions.
qStmt	31		Fundamental organometallic mechanism 11b: Attack of a nucleophile on a coordinated multiple bond drawn as a metallacyclopropane.  Remember that when the metal has at least two valence electrons, alkene&#8211;metal complexes can be drawn as the corresponding metallacyclopropanes.  The mechanism of attack of a nucleophile on a metal-coordinated alkene is easy to draw when the alkene&#8211;metal complex is drawn in the metallacyclopropane form.  In box 2, draw the electron-flow arrows that will lead to the compound in box 3, and submit.
evalFeedback	31	1	Good!  As illustrated earlier, you could equally well have drawn the first step of the mechanism as the formation of two Pd-C #sigma bonds with two two-electron electron-flow arrows.
