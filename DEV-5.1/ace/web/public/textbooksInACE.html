<p>An ACE instructor can author his or her own textbook within ACE. To author a 
new textbook or to continue to author an existing one, an instructor presses the
<span class="link">Textbooks</span> button. A menu of all the existing textbooks 
in ACE appears.
</p>

<h3>Authoring ACE textbooks</h3>

<p>Each ACE textbook is assigned to an owner, i.e., the instructor who first 
created it. The owner
of a textbook may designate coauthors, who may also modify the ACE textbook. 
</p>

<p>An instructor may modify an existing textbook even if she is neither an owner
nor a designated coauthor. In this case,
ACE makes a copy of the textbook and makes her the owner of the copy. Thereafter,
her copy and the original are independent of one another.
</p>

<p>An ACE textbook consists of <i>chapters</i>, each of which contains any number of
pieces of <i>content</i>.
Content may take many forms:
<ul><li>text;
</li><li>a 
or <a href="http://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/marvin-for-javascript"
target="window2">MarvinJS</a> drawing;
</li><li>a LewisJS drawing;
</li><li>an image;
</li><li>a URL of an image located elsewhere on the Web;
</li><li>a movie;
</li><li>a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/" target="window2">JSmol</a> 
figure;
</li><li>an ACE question.
</li></ul>

<p>As part of the authoring process, an author may move pieces of content 
within a chapter or from one chapter to another.
An author may also establish hyperlinks within and between chapters.
</p>

<h3>ACE textbooks in ACE courses</h3>

<p>The instructor of a course
may assign any ACE textbook to a particular ACE course. In that case, the students in 
that course will be able to read the ACE textbook and work ACE questions that have
been embedded in it. In the case of 
<a href="authoring.html#Rgroup">R-group questions</a> and 
<a href="authoring.html#numeric">numeric questions with variables</a>, 
ACE does not permanently assign instantiated R groups or values to students
who work those questions in the textbook; in other words, a student will see
a different version of the question each time he or she works it.
