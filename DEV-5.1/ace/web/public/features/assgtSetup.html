<h3>Creating an assignment</h3>

<p>On the <a href="courseSetup.html#crsHome">course home page</a>, press the 
<b>Assignment</b> tab to see the assignment list page.  Initially,
it has no assignments.  Press <b>Add new</b> to start assembling an 
assignment.  ACE will then bring you to the assignment content assembly page.
</p>

<p>On the left, ACE displays questions from the database, from which you choose
questions to add to the assignment, and on the right, ACE displays the questions that 
you have already added to the assignment.  There are three ways to choose questions from
the database: by topic, by textbook, and by keyword.  Most instructors find it most useful to
select questions by topic.  As you select names of topics and question sets from the pulldown 
menus, the questions in those sets appear on the left.  You select questions from this list
to add to your assignment.
</p>

You can choose to allow students an unlimited number of tries per question,
or you can limit the number of tries.
You can choose to make a question "depend" on an earlier one; if you do, ACE will
show the later question to the student only after the student has answered the earlier 
one correctly.  
</p>

<p>
You can also choose to randomize the assignment, so that different students see 
different subsets of a group of questions.  
</p>

<p>After you have saved the content of the assignment, you can set its due date and time
and tell ACE whether ACE should enforce the due date or whether the due date is merely a suggestion.
You can also set grading parameters that change the number of points per question or reduce
credit for late responses or for responses that take multiple attempts.  
</p>

<p>After you submit your changes, ACE will return you to the assignment list page.  
ACE will provide a link to any grading parameters that you added to the assignment; 
students will be able to see these parameters as well.  
</p>

<p>ACE also provides a link directly back to the assignment properties page, where you
can grant extensions on an assignment.  Simply press the <b>Edit</b> icon
next to "[no extensions]," and ACE will bring you back to the assignment properties page.
Click on <b>Extensions</b> to get a list of students in the class, and enter the desired
extension next to the appropriate student's name.
