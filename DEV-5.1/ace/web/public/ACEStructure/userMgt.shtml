<h3>User Management</h3>

<p>Users register themselves in ACE.  The user enters
the information that ACE then stores in 
<span class="database">institutions_v1</span> 
and <span class="database">users_v4</span> in the
course of the registration process.  The ACE administrator must verify the
identity of any user who registers as an instructor before that individual may
use ACE. The ACE administrator may choose to grant
master <a href="qbank.shtml">authoring</a> or 
<a href="intlizn.shtml">translating</a>
privileges to the instructor.  </p>

<p>Originally, ACE stored every user's password, email address, and security 
questions for password reset in its own database. Now, if a registrant 
indicates that he attends the ACE installation's default university, ACE 
outsources the username/password authentication process to a campus server 
using the LDAP protocol. Users who are not at the default university
or who registered with ACE before we implemented the new authentication 
process must continue to use the usernames and passwords they originally 
entered.</p>

<p>Each time a user logs into ACE, ACE creates a <span
class="classname">User</span> object and populates it with information that it
retrieves from the <span class="database">users_v4</span> table.  </p>

<p>Users may designate one or more <a href="intlizn.shtml">languages</a> 
that they prefer over English via the <span class="link">My Profile</span> 
page. For students at institutions whose primary language 
of instruction is not English, ACE automatically assigns them that
language, and these students may not delete that
language from their list of languages.
