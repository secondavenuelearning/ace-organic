<h3>Course Management</h3>
<p>The page that users see when they log in is the user home page, 
<span class="filename">userHome.jsp</span>.  From this page, an 
instructor can create, modify, or delete ACE courses.  This
page may also display a system notice that ACE retrieves from the course notes 
of the <span class="coursename">Tutorials</span> course.</p>

<!--#include file="db/cw_courses.html"-->

<p>An instructor may designate one or more instructors 
(at the same institution or elsewhere) as coinstructors for a particular course.
A coinstructor has all the privileges of the owner of the course.  (An
instructor may also assign <a href="#TA">TAs</a>, who have many
fewer privileges than coinstructors, to a course.)  However,
when a coinstructor <a href="assgnts.shtml">assembles an assignment</a>, the 
coinstructor sees the <i>course owner's</i> new questions and modifications to 
existing questions, not the coinstructor's own.  If a coinstructor wishes to 
<a href="qbank.shtml">author questions</a> for the course's students to use, the 
coinstructor must explicitly assign any authoring he or she does to the course 
owner.</p>

<!--#include file="db/coinstructors.html"-->

<p>The instructor uses functions in the
<span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab to enroll students in the course.  
Instructors can choose to
enroll individual students who have already registered with ACE, or they can
upload a list of students and their ID numbers.  In the latter case, ACE matches
student ID numbers provided by the instructor with those provided by students as
they registered with ACE; when it finds a match, it enrolls the student in the
course.  It continues to look for matches as new students register.  </p>

<!--#include file="db/preenrollment.html"-->

<p>ACE stores the enrollment information
in <span class="database">cw_course_enrollment_v3</span>.  
ACE automatically enrolls students in a <span class="coursename">Tutorials</span>
course that the ACE designers created to make the tutorials readily available.
</p>

<!--#include file="db/cw_course_enrollment.html"-->

<p>When users enter a course by clicking on its name, they arrive at the course
home page, <span class="filename">course/courseHome.jsp</span>.  Students
see three or four tabs at this point: <span class="link">Course Home</span>, 
<a href="assgnts.shtml" class="link">Assignments</a>,
<a href="gradebook.shtml" class="link">Grades</a>, and perhaps
<a href="forums.shtml" class="link">Forum</a>.  Instructors also see 
an <span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab.
Instructors can modify the notes that appear to the student.  
If the instructor is <span class="username">ace-master</span>, and the course is
the <span class="coursename">Tutorials</span> course, the notes become a System
Notice that ACE displays to all users on the user home page.  </p>

<a name="TA"/>
<p>The <span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab, 
<span class="filename">enroll/listEnrollment.jsp</span>, shows a list of 
students who have enrolled in the course and their student IDs (if required by 
the instructor) and email addresses.  An instructor can choose to remove a 
student from the course or block a student from the course's discussion
forum.  In addition, an instructor may 
promote an enrolled student to the role of TA (teaching assistant) of that
course or demote a TA to the role of regular student.  ACE omits TAs from the 
course gradebook, and it does not save to the database a TA's work on 
<a href="solve.shtml">assignments</a> in courses for which that student 
is a TA.  ACE displays the course enrollment list 
and the course <a href="gradebook.shtml">gradebook</a> to TAs, 
but TAs may not alter a student's grades or do a forced regrade of a question
without the instructor's permission (set in the Course editing page),
and TAs may never
disenroll students from a course, promote other students to TA,   
or gain access to the <a href="qbank.shtml">question bank</a>. 
ACE stores whether a student is a TA in the <span class="database">isTA</span>
field in <span class="database">cw_course_enrollment_v3</span>, so a student 
may be a TA in some courses but not others.</p>

<a name="exams"/>
<h4>Administering Exams</h4>

<p>ACE has several features that make it easier
for instructors to administer <a href="exams.html">exams</a> within ACE.  
Under the <span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab, an instructor can create 
a set of 
random login IDs, one for each student who will be taking the exam.  
ACE records the random login IDs in 
<span class="database">exam_students_v2</span> and 
<span class="database">users_v4</span> and enrolls them in the current 
course.  The instructor then assigns each random login ID to a student about 
to take the exam.  
Students have no way of knowing the random login IDs of other students.  </p>

<!--#include file="db/exam_students.html"-->

<p>After the <a href="exams.html">exam</a>, 
under the <span class="link">Enrollment</span> tab, 
the instructor can transfer the students' work from 
the random login IDs to the students' regular login IDs.  ACE changes the
random login IDs to their regular ones in the  
students' enrollment records and in the records of their responses to all
questions in the assignment. </p>

<p>Additionally, an instructor may restrict access to an exam course 
to computers operating from certain IP addresses.  The instructor sets the
allowable IP addresses on the course editing page.
</p>

<!--#include file="db/allowed_ips.html"-->

<p>Additionally, an instructor may set a password for a course. The
instructor sets the password on the course editing page.</p>

<p>In order to prevent unscrupulous instructors 
from distributing random login IDs to students so the students can avoid 
purchasing access keys, the random login IDs become unusable after two weeks.  
However, the instructor is still able to see the work of the students who used 
those IDs.</p>
