<h3>Topics and question sets</h3>

<p>The questions in ACE are organized into topics, each of which is organized
into subtopics, a.k.a. question sets or problem sets.
</p>

<!--#include file="db/chapters.html"-->

<!--#include file="db/pbsets.html"-->

<p>When instructors press the <span class="link">Question Bank</span>
button, they first see the question set display page, <span
class="filename">authortool/questionsList.jsp</span>.  The top
section contains navigation tools and displays information about the currently
selected question set.  The bottom section displays the selected question set.
</p>

<p>The top section contains a link, <span class="link">Edit topics &amp;
question sets</span>, that brings the author to the topics display page, <span
class="filename">authortool/qstore/topicsEditor.jsp</span>.  A local author
(instructor) may use this page to add a new question set to a topic.  The
contents of the question set will be visible only to the creator and his or her
students.  A master author may also edit the information of existing topics and
question sets or add new topics.  </p>

<p>An instructor may also use the pulldown menus in <span
class="filename">questionsList.jsp</span> to select a topic and a question
set.  ACE displays the name, remarks, and common question statement of that
question set in the section on the
upper right.  The common question statement is appended to the beginning of
every question in that set.  instructors may edit the
common question statements of either database or locally authored question sets
by pressing the <span class="link">Edit</span> icon next to the statement.
After an instructor modifies a database common question statement, a <span
class="link">Revert</span> icon will appear next to the <span
class="link">Edit</span> icon.  ACE stores the modified common question
statements in <span class="database">modified_headers_v2</span>.  </p>

<!--#include file="db/modified_headers.html"-->

<p>When an instructor chooses a question set from the pulldown menu, ACE
displays the list of <a href="questions.shtml">questions</a> in that question
set.  ACE normally lists questions in order of their unique ID numbers (which 
reflects the order in which they were authored), with master-database questions 
listed first and locally authored questions last.  However, a master author may 
reorder the master-database questions, and a local author may reoder his or 
her own questions.  Note: ACE recalls from the database,
stores, and displays only some of the data associated with each question on the
question set display page (light load).  It recalls neither the second and
subsequent <a href="questions.shtml#figs">figures</a>, nor the molecular
structures associated with <a href="questions.shtml#evals">evaluators</a> and
<a href="questions.shtml#qData">question data</a>.  Only when an instructor
chooses to edit a particular question does ACE load the additional data (full
load).  </p>

<p>If a student or the instructor has been <a href="solve.shtml">solving a
question</a> in an assignment, and the instructor is dissatisfied with the <a
href="questions.shtml#stmt">question statement</a>, <a
href="questions.shtml#evals">evaluators, or feedback</a> and so wants to <a
href="questions.shtml">modify them</a>, the instructor can acquire the unique
ID number of the question from the <a href="solve.shtml">questions list</a>
page (not visible to students), press <span class="link">Question Bank</span>,
enter the number in the textbox in the upper section of the question set
display page, and press <span class="link">Go</span> to go directly to the
question-editing page for that question.  </p>

<p>An instructor can choose to add a <a href="questions.shtml">question</a> to
a set by pressing the <span class="link">Add Question</span> button, or she may
edit a question by pressing the <span class="link">Edit</span> icon next to the
question's serial number in the set.  An instructor can delete a question that
she has authored (unless it is included in an
<a href="assgnts.shtml">assignment</a> as a randomized question), and she can 
revert a modified question back to the database version.  </p>

<p>An instructor can move one or more questions from one question set to 
another in the same topic or a different one if he or she has authored the 
question. The author selects the question(s) and then presses 
<span class="link">Relocate</span>.</p>

<p>An instructor can also choose to export some or all of the questions in a
set or to import questions into the set.  Exporting and importing questions is
the only way that instructors can share locally authored questions with other
instructors.  However, when ACE imports a question, it treats
it as a brand-new question, even if its copy exists elsewhere in the database.
Do not confuse exporting and importing <a href="questions.shtml">questions</a>
with exporting and importing <a href="assgnts.shtml">assignments</a>.  </p>

<p>When an instructor exports one or more questions, ACE converts the questions
into a semireadable XML format and writes the XML to a text document.  ACE
bundles the XML document into a zip file along with any figures associated with
the exported questions.  Instructors may share this zip file with others.  If
an instructor wishes to import the questions, he uploads the zip file (not the
XML file) to ACE.  Many ACE classes contain methods called <span
class="filename">toXML()</span> and <span class="filename">parseXML()</span>,
which are the methods responsible for export and import, respectively.  </p>

<p>If instructor A has designated B as a coinstructor of a course,
and B wants to make changes in the database that will be visible to the
students of the shared course, then B should choose A from the <span
class="link">Select coinstructor</span> menu.  ACE will assign to A any changes
that B makes thenceforth in the current authoring session.  Note that the
changes will <i>not</i> be visible to students in any courses that B has
created.  Instructor B can resume claiming his or her own work by pressing
<span class="link">Question Bank</span> again.  </p>
