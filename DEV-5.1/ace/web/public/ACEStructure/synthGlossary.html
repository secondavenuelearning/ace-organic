<h3>ACE Reaction Definitions Glossary</h3>


<p>The reaction definition consists of MRV reaction definitions separated by the
following dividers:</p>

<table class="nonDbTable" >
<tr><th>Divider</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>***AND_DO*** </td><td> products and unreacted substrates from the
prior reaction are subjected to the next reaction. 
</td></tr><tr><td>***IF_NO_PRODS_DO*** </td><td> the subsequent reactions are executed only
if the prior ones produced no products.
</td></tr><tr><td>***RESUBJECT_TO*** </td><td> the starting materials for the previous 
reaction should be applied again to this reaction.
</td></tr><tr><td>***FNAL_GROUPS{ groupname; groupname; ... }*** </td><td> 
<a href="../fnalGroups.jsp">functional groups</a> 
that substrates must have for reaction to proceed; should come immediately
after any of the preceding dividers and applies to all subsequent reactions
until turned off by the same sequence with no group names listed.  Group numbers
can be used in place of group names.
</td></tr><tr><td> ***(***<br/> ***)*** </td><td>group reaction definitions.

<p>Reaction definition (RxnMolecule) properties used by SynthSolver:</p>

<table class="nonDbTable" >
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>Number of reactants</td><td> integer </td><td>the number of substrates that 
must have been submitted by the user; e.g., for Grignard addition to an ester, the
user cannot supply two different Grignard reagents if this property has value 2.
</td></tr><tr><td>Stop after one reaction</td><td> true</td><td> the products of the 
reaction will not be resubjected to the reaction.
</td></tr><tr><td>Major or minor product</td><td> "major" or "minor" (in practice, only "minor"
will be used)</td><td> does this reaction definition give minor products only?
</td></tr><tr><td>Major or minor explanation</td><td> a String</td><td> provides feedback to student 
as to why this reaction definition gives minor products, e.g., "The Diels-Alder
reaction provides mostly the endo product." for the exo reaction definition.
</td></tr><tr><td>Keep permuting</td><td> true</td><td> don't end trying different 
permutations after the first successful combination.  Used in aldol reactions, 
where partners can swap places.
</td></tr><tr><td>Do not specify configurations</td><td> true</td><td> don't specify 
configurations in the reaction products.
</td></tr><tr><td>Asymmetric</td><td> true</td><td> reaction is asymmetric.
</td></tr><tr><td>Functional group of substrate to clone</td><td> name of functional group</td><td>
when a reaction definition requires more than one copy of a substrate, the functional group
of the substrate that should be cloned
</td></tr><tr><td>Stoichiometry of substrate to clone</td><td> integer</td><td>when 
a reaction definition requires more than one copy of a substrate, 
how many copies of the substrate are required by the reaction.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Reactor product (Molecule) properties set by SynthSolver:</p>

<table class="nonDbTable" >
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>Reactor index</td><td> integer </td><td>how many times Reactor was called for
a particular substrate combination before this product was obtained
</td></tr><tr><td>Major or minor</td><td> "major" or "minor"</td><td> is this compound produced by a 
reaction that gives minor products only?
</td></tr><tr><td>Major or minor explanation</td><td> a String </td><td> provides feedback to student 
as to why this reaction definition gives minor products, e.g., "The Diels-Alder
reaction provides mostly the exo product." for the endo reaction definition
</td></tr><tr><td>Reacted</td><td> true</td><td> denotes products of prior reactions that have
reacted further and should be removed from the list of reaction products
</td></tr><tr><td>Racemize</td><td> true </td><td> denotes diastereopure but racemic 
products of achiral or racemic starting materials, or starting material that 
has racemized; also set by SynthStage
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Reactor product (Molecule) properties set by other classes:</p>

<table class="nonDbTable" >
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Set by</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>Expanded stereoisomer</td><td> SynthParser </td><td>
when a student submits a compound with ambiguous tetrahedral stereochemistry,
SynthParser generates all stereoisomers before storing them in the SynthStage; 
it gives each stereoisomer the value m:n, where m is the number of molecules 
already in the stage (plus one) and n is the stereoisomer number; used to 
identify whether a student ran a reaction producing certain isomers but not 
others, and failed to show which isomers were produced
</td></tr><tr><td>Producing stage box index</td><td> Synthesis.checkValidRxnProducts()</td><td>
the object index of the box of the stage whose reaction produces the compound
</td></tr>
