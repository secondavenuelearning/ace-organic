<h2 style="text-align:center;">Translating ACE into languages other than English</h2>

<p>ACE has the capability of storing translations of its content
in a variety of languages, and displaying that content to its users
in whatever language they prefer.

<h3>Choosing a language</h3>

<p>All users who want to use ACE must register with the system once. 
When an instructor registers with ACE, she is given a list of 
institutions from which to choose. If her institution is not listed,
she may choose "Other" and enter its name. She then has the
opportunity to choose her institution's primary language of instruction
from ACE's menu of languages or to type the name of a new language. 
ACE will then assign that language 
automatically to all students who register from that institution.
(Of course, much more work is required before ACE can translate the 
content into that language.) 
</p>

<p>At any time, students or instructors may choose a 
language that they prefer over English 
by pressing <span class="link">My Profile</span>. A user may also
choose more than one language and indicate an order of preference,
and a user may also choose to delete a language.
However, if ACE assigns a language to a student because that language
is the primary language of instruction at the student's institution,
then the student may not delete that language from her list of
languages.
</p>

<h3>Displaying content in a language other than English</h3>

<p>Throughout the program (except in the Question Bank),
whenever ACE displays text to the user, it searches its database for
translations of that text into the user's preferred languages. If it finds
translations in more than one of the user's preferred languages, it chooses the 
translation in the most-preferred language. If it fails to find a translation 
in any of the user's preferred languages, it displays the text in English.  </p>


<h3>Entering translations</h3>

<p>The ACE administrator may confer translator privileges 
on selected instructors.  These instructors then have the authority to enter or 
modify translations in their chosen languages.
</p>

<p>Translators should feel free to use any characters that their language 
requires. Translators may also use character entity references, such as 
&amp;delta; and &amp;rarr; for the &delta; and &rarr; characters. The
textbox will display &amp;delta; or &amp;rarr;, but users will see 
&delta; or &rarr;. (However, if a translator enters a character entity
reference in numerical format, such as &amp;#8594;, then when ACE 
redisplays the translation in a textbox, it will display not the 
character entity reference 
&amp;#8594;, but the character &#8594; to which it refers.)
</p>

<p>ACE automatically formats chemical formulas and common 
chemical expressions.  For example, if an author enters 
CH3CO2^- or sp3-hybridized,
ACE automatically formats them to 
CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> 
and <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>-hybridized.
(Please see ACE's 
<a href="toDisplay.jsp">toDisplay() 
tester</a> for more information on how ACE formats text.) 
However, translators may choose to use HTML formatting tags such as
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to format text as well.
</p>

<p>ACE divides into two groups the phrases that it translates:
question sets (question statements, evaluator feedback, 
etc.), and general phrases
(instructions, button labels, alerts, 
automatically generated feedback, etc.). </p>

<h3>Entering translations of general phrases</h3>

<p>An authorized translator who presses the
<span class="link">Question Bank</span> button to enter the
question bank will see a 
<span class="link">Translate General</span> button.  The translator presses 
this button to enter translations of ca. 1300 phrases hardwired into ACE. 
Many of these phrases are similar, and many are very short (one word or
even an abbreviation), so the translator can expect to be able to translate
about 100 phrases per hour. </p>

<p>Many general phrases have a variable part; for example, "(you earned 
<i>x</i>)".  Rather than storing a separate translation for every possible 
number in this phrase, ACE stores a single example phrase that contains a
placeholder demarcated by ***, e.g., "(you earned ***0.5***)". ACE will
replace the demarcated part with the appropriate value when it displays
the phrase to the user. It is important that, when so instructed, the 
translator leave the
placeholder inside the *** symbols <i>unchanged</i> in the translated 
phrase, so that ACE knows where it should insert the variable content.
</p>

<p>Translators should take special care to end their translation with
a period when a phrase ends with a period, and not to do so when it 
does not.
</p>

<p>Even after a translator enters translations for all of the general
phrases, students may still occasionally encounter untranslated phrases.
The reason is that ACE only adds a phrase to the database of translatable 
phrases when it first displays it to a user. At that time, it will add
the phrase to its database of translatable phrases, but of course
a translator won't yet have entered a translation for that phrase. For 
this reason, a translator should occasionally check the general phrases 
list to see if ACE has added to it any new phrases that need translating.
</p>

<h3>Entering translations of question sets</h3>

<p>If, after pressing the <span class="link">Question Bank</span> 
button, the translator chooses a topic and then a question set, the
<span class="link">Translate General</span> button will change to 
<span class="link">Translate Set</span>.  The translator presses this
button to enter translations of the questions
in the chosen question set. 
</p>

<p>A question set has up to four kinds of content that need to 
be translated: the common question statement, each question's 
statement, the feedback for each evaluator of each question, and
any question data that the question may need to display (such as
options in a multiple-choice question or molecule names in a 
ranking question). A particular question set may lack
a common question statement, and a particular question
may have a blank statement or no queston data.
</p>

<p>When a translator first enters the question 
set translation tool, ACE displays only the common question
statement (if there is one) of the question set and the statements 
of each individual question in the set.
If the translator clicks 
<span class="link">Common question statement</span>,
a textbox will appear in which the translator should enter 
the translation. If the translator clicks on the 
<span class="link">Edit</span> icon next
to an individual question, ACE will display that question's statement,
question data (if any), and evaluator feedbacks, along with 
textboxes for the translation of each. Clicking on the
<span class="link">Edit</span> icon again will return
that question to its original contracted display state, but ACE will 
not lose any translations that the translator entered into the
textboxes.  With each evaluator,
ACE also displays in green the condition under which a response
triggers that particular feedback;  
the translator should <i>not</i> translate this text.
</p>

<p>When a translator saves a translation of a particular phrases,
ACE looks to see if that phrase is repeated anywhere else in the
content, and, if it is, it assigns the translation to those other
instances of the phrase as well. This feature saves the translator
from having to repeatedly enter the same translation. As a result,
a translator should save her work often. </p>

<p>If a translator wishes to alter a translation, the translator 
should simply alter it and save the altered version. If a translator
wishes to delete a translation without replacing it with another one,
the translator must enter ***ERASE*** in the textbox. ACE will ignore 
a blank textbox.
</p>

<h3>Authoring and translations</h3>

<p>ACE divides its content into <i>master-authored</i> 
and <i>locally authored</i> content. The ACE administrators have granted 
master-author status to a handful of instructors. When these instructors 
write content, their work
becomes visible to all users, and when they make changes to existing
content, those changes propagate out to all users as well. Most instructors,
however, are local authors. When a local author writes a new question,
only that instructor (and her students) can see the new question. Moreover,
if a local author modifies a master-authored question, ACE makes a copy
of the master-authored question and assigns it to the local author, so that
the local author is actually making changes to a locally authored question,
and, again, only that instructor (and her students) can see the changes. 
</p>

<p>The question set translation tool displays <i>only</i> the 
master-authored questions in a question set. A translator using this 
page will not see
any locally authored content, even if it is content that the translator 
has authored herself. If an instructor with only local-author privileges 
wants his students to see the content that he has authored in a language 
other than English, he must write his content in
that language, and it will appear to students only in that language.
</p>

<p>Having said that, suppose that an instructor modifies an existing 
master-authored question
by adding a single new evaluator. If a translator has already translated
the question statement or the feedback of the other evaluators in the
question, then those translations will continue to appear to the 
instructor's students; and, if
a translator later translates the question statement or the feedback in 
the original master-authored question, that translation will apply as well
to phrases that have remained unchanged in the locally-authored question.
On the other hand, if the instructor has modified a question statement 
or an evaluator's feedback, his students will always see exactly what
he has written, whether it is in English or another language.
</p>

<p>A master author may occasionally modify existing content. If she
modifies a question statement, evaluator, or question
datum of an existing question and then saves the question, ACE deletes all 
translations associated with the modified item, preserving translations of those
question parts that remain unmodified. However, if she moves evaluators or 
question data within a list, ACE preserves the translations associated with
them.  </p>

<p>If a master author duplicates an existing question, ACE will copy all 
translations associated with the original question and associate them with the
new question. However, editing the question statement, evaluators, or question
data will cause ACE to delete the translations associated with those items. </p>
