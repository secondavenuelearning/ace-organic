The files here need to be placed in the Marvin/JChem distribution.

	BASE=[directory in which you place the JChem distribution]
	JCHEM=[level of the JChem distribution, such as 5.3.6]
	JBASE=$BASE/jchem$JCHEM

If you are using the Marvin that comes with JChem, then 

	MBASE=$JBASE/marvin

If you are using a different Marvin (the most recent JChem has defective
Marvin), then
	
	MARVIN=[level of the JChem distribution containing the Marvin you are using, such as 5.2.6]
	MBASE=$BASE/jchem$MARVIN/marvin

for all files ACE* 
    symlink to them from $MBASE/chemaxon/marvin/templates/

for all files configuration*
    symlink to them from $MBASE/

for evaluator.xml
    symlink to it from $JBASE/config/

These actions are performed by scripts/configureJChem.pl and
scripts/configureMarvin.pl, for UKY use only.

Prior to Marvin 5/JChem 5, evaluator.xml goes in /root/.chemaxon/ 
where root is the owner of Tomcat (the same directory in which the 
licenses.dat file is kept).
