The jchem files should go in this directory. The current version of 
ACE is using jchem version 20.16. Other versions may not work as intended.

If you plan on using a different version of jchem, you will want to update the configureJChem
perl script located in DEV-5.1/marvin-extra/scripts. You must also update the jchem directory name to reflect the 
jchem version you are using.
